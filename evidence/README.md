# Evidence bundles

Each subdirectory is one complete execution of `crates/maxplayer-tool-kit/docker/demo.sh`,
named by its UTC start time. A bundle holds per-step verdicts (`results.txt`), both MCP
transcripts, holder and vendor logs, vendor counter snapshots, and a `manifest.json`.

Every bundle here is `mechanism_only`. The vendor and the CLI were both written for this
contract and therefore cannot falsify it: these runs establish that the holder mechanism
behaves as specified, not that any third-party tool has been accepted.

## Why there are two bundles from 2026-09-09

`20260909T220053Z` and `20260909T220105Z` are two runs started twelve seconds apart. That
overlap was not intentional.

An earlier version of this file blamed a turn killed mid-flight by a provider error. That was a
guess presented as fact, and it was probably wrong: two sessions were writing this worktree and
branch at the time, and on 2026-09-09 15:06 PDT the second was ordered to stop and this author
was made sole writer. The second run is most likely the other session's.

**What the artifacts actually support:** two executions started twelve seconds apart, on
separate networks, volumes and container names, on the same Docker daemon, both completing
27/27. **What they do not support:** attribution. Both sessions committed under the worktree
identity `w-seller-tool-onboarding-r2`, and no artifact records the launching process, so which
session produced which bundle cannot be established from what is here. Stating it either way
would be invention.

They are kept rather than pruned, because deleting an inconvenient artifact is a worse habit
than explaining it, and because two runs that agree are mildly better than one.

| | `20260909T220053Z` | `20260909T220105Z` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| checks passed | 27 | 27 |
| checks failed | 0 | 0 |
| verdict | PASS | PASS |
| platform | linux/arm64, docker 29.5.2 | linux/arm64, docker 29.5.2 |

The check *names* are identical between the two; the only textual differences are the run id
and the output path. Either bundle can be read as the record of the run; citing one is not a
claim that the other disagrees.

One caveat worth stating rather than leaving implicit: because the runs overlapped in time on
a shared Docker daemon, they are not independent in the strong sense — a daemon-level fault
could in principle have affected both. Each run does use its own network, volumes and
container names, so they do not share holder state, vendor state or sockets.
