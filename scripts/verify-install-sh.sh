#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Acceptance verifier for `install.sh` — drives the installer inside clean containers against a real
# published release and asserts every property #125 asks for, including the refusals.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/verify-install-sh.sh <version> [path-to-install.sh]
#     e.g. ./scripts/verify-install-sh.sh 0.0.1
#
# `<version>` must be a version whose GitHub Release is published with linux assets. The installer is
# pointed at it explicitly, so this works against a pre-release too — which matters, because
# `/releases/latest` (the default path) has nothing to answer with until a stable release exists.
#
# ── Why containers, and why two ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The claim is "installs on a machine that has never heard of nix", so it has to be tested somewhere
# that has no nix, no rust and no prior maxplayer. Since #745 the installer probes nix first and
# refuses (no TTY) or chains Determinate (TTY) when it is missing; the no-nix refusal is proven on
# the image as-is, and a PATH stub is injected only after that so the download/verify legs still
# run. The two images are not redundant:
#
#   alpine:3              musl; busybox wget, NO curl   → exercises the wget branch, zero packages added
#   debian:bookworm-slim  glibc; neither downloader     → curl installed, exercises the curl branch
#
# Between them both libc families and both download branches are covered. Committing to one image
# would leave whichever branch it lacks entirely unexecuted.
#
# ── Why the refusals are driven through shims ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A corrupt-download test needs the bytes to change between the release and the checksum comparison.
# The alternative — an env var telling install.sh where to fetch from, or one telling it to skip
# verification — would mean the shipped script carries a switch that turns the security property off,
# and the test would then be exercising a code path no user takes. So instead a wrapper is placed
# ahead of the real downloader on PATH and corrupts what it wrote. install.sh runs completely
# unmodified, exactly as a user gets it.
#
# ★ The pass-through control (leg 6) is what makes legs 7-11 mean anything. With a shim in the way, a
#   refusal could just as easily be the shim having broken downloading altogether — so the same shim
#   is first run in a mode that tampers with nothing and required to produce a successful install.
