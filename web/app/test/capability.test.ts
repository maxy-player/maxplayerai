/**
 * The seat capability advertisement (#784), from wire tag to Profile row.
 *
 * Two things are under test and they fail differently. The READ is a spelling
 * contract with the publisher: the tag names below are typed as raw literals,
 * never imported, so a change to what `events.ts` looks for goes red here
 * rather than silently rendering an empty Profile. The DISPLAY is a claim about
 * what a buyer sees — which annotation each value wears, and which wears none —
 * and that is asserted against rendered markup, because a source-text grep
 * cannot tell a marker that reaches the page from one that is built and dropped.
 *
 * ⚠ SCOPE OF THE SPELLING PIN. It pins THIS side only. Nothing in web/app goes
 * red on a rename in `crates/maxplayer-core/src/heartbeat.rs`, so a
 * publisher-side rename lands as blank rows over a green suite. That
 * cross-check belongs beside the emitter and is tracked as #888.
