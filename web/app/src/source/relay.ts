/**

 * hint when the store already holds the past), then keeps itself current in
 * one of two ways:
 *
 *   poll   — one `since: newest − overlap` REQ per tick, closed on its own
 *            EOSE (the overlap is POLL_OVERLAP_SECONDS in config.ts).
 *            MEASURED 7/28 on the production relay: it answers stored-event
 *            queries anonymously but never streams post-EOSE (NIP-42 AUTH
 *            gates the live feed), so a long-lived REQ sits there looking
 *            healthy and delivering nothing.
 *   stream — one long-lived REQ left open; the relay pushes each new event
 *            the moment it lands. THE MODE TO SWITCH TO once the relay is
 *            upgraded — flip TRANSPORT in config.ts, nothing else changes.
 *
 * The socket is injectable so the whole lifecycle is testable without a network.
