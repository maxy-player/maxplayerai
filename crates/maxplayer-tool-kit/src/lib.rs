//! Seller-level tool holder.
//!
//! The shape this crate implements, and the one correction that defines it:
//!
//! > "the seller is defined by it's offering, there is no offering per job, it is per seller,
//! > tool should at all times be active together with the seller daemon" — Petar, 2026-09-09
//!
//! So: the offering and the allowed operation list are **seller configuration**. The tool is
//! enrolled once and stays logged in for as long as the daemon runs. No award, payment, job
//! start or job completion opens, closes, or renews anything. Jobs of that seller call an
//! interface that is already up.
//!
//! What this crate does still enforce, because none of it is an entitlement question:
//! credentials stay outside buyer-controlled job containers; there is no shell and no argv
//! passthrough; operation parameters are validated against the seller's declared list; file
//! access is confined to the calling job's own directory; and the endpoint answers only the
//! seller's authorized clients.
//!
//! Availability is intended while the daemon runs. That is not a guarantee against vendor
//! failure, and confining *parameters* is not protection against a seller authorizing an
//! operation whose legitimate use a buyer then directs.
