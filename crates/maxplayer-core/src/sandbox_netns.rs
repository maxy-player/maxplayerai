//! Establishing egress containment inside the job's own network namespace (#797).
//!
//! [`crate::sandbox_net`] renders the policy; this module puts it in force. Three containers, in one
//! order that is not negotiable:
//!
//! 1. a **holder** — a trivial container that exists only to own a network namespace,
//! 2. a **sidecar** — joins that namespace, applies the rendered rules, exits,
//! 3. the **job** — joins the same namespace, and so starts with the rules already in place.
//!
//! The holder is what closes the race. A sidecar cannot apply rules to a namespace that does not
//! exist yet, and a job that creates its own namespace is already running before anything can be
//! installed into it — measured at 236 ms of uncontained execution. By making a third container own
//! the namespace, the rules are in force *before the job process exists at all*, so the window is not
//! narrowed, it is absent.
//!
//! ## Why the job's argv changes shape here
//!
//! `--network=container:<holder>` puts the job in the holder's namespace, and the daemon then refuses
//! several networking flags outright — `--add-host` among them:
//!
//! ```text
//! docker: Error response from daemon: conflicting options: custom host-to-IP mapping and the network mode
//! ```
//!
//! So the job cannot be given the `host.docker.internal` alias it used to reach the credential proxy,
//! and putting `--add-host` on the *holder* would be theatre: `/etc/hosts` is per-mount-namespace and
//! these containers share only the network one. The job therefore receives a **literal address**, and
//! [`host_gateway_probe_argv`] measures it rather than computing it — see the warning there, because
//! the obvious computation is wrong in a way no rendering test can see.
//!
//! Name resolution needs its own answer. A container joining the namespace still gets its own
//! `/etc/resolv.conf` pointing at docker's embedded resolver on `127.0.0.11`, which is why
//! `sandbox_net`'s "loopback is never denied" test is load-bearing rather than decorative for a
//! runc seat. Under gVisor that resolver never answers at all — the sandbox terminates loopback in
//! its own network stack, so the packet never reaches the daemon's socket — so a contained job is
//! handed a real resolver file instead and this module carries the addresses inside it through to
//! the policy, one port-53 exception per resolver. See [`crate::sandbox_dns`].
