//! Container-side delivery orchestration (Track B): the git steps that must NOT run against a
//! repository the job agent could write.
//!
//! ## The exploit this closes
//! The job agent has full write access to its workdir, INCLUDING `workdir/.git/config`. libgit2
//! applies `url.<other>.insteadOf = <relay>` rewrite rules from the config of the repository that
//! RUNS an operation — when it creates the remote, for `remote_anonymous` too. [`crate::git_transport`]
//! empties the global/XDG/system config search paths so no ambient config is read, but a repo-LOCAL
//! `.git/config` in the agent's own workdir is still consulted. So if the seller host opens the
//! agent's workdir and pushes, the agent's planted `insteadOf` silently redirects that push — with
//! the seller's signed NIP-98 token — to a host the agent chose. Test:
//! `tests/hostile_local_git_config.rs`.
//!
//! A config rewrite alone does not close this. libgit2 also reads `.git/commondir` and resolves the
//! config (and `objects` and `refs`) through the directory that file names; a `.git` that is a
//! gitfile or a symlink points elsewhere too. A job that leaves such a layout behind and exits makes
//! a rewrite of `workdir/.git/config` edit the wrong file.
//!
//! ## The fix: refuse the layout, replace the config, bind the destination
//! [`push_delivery`] runs three layers, in order, before and during the push:
//! 1. **Layout gate** ([`crate::seller_git::assert_plain_repo_layout`], run by both the config
//!    replacement and the push-side repository open): `.git` must be a real directory, no
//!    `.git/commondir` entry may exist, and `.git/config` must be a regular file or absent. The
//!    repository is opened with `NO_SEARCH` and its `path()` must canonicalize to `workdir/.git`.
//! 2. **Config replacement** ([`crate::seller_git::neutralize_push_config`]): `.git/config` is
//!    unlinked and re-created with a fixed, minimal, redirect-free file — a whole-file replacement
//!    that removes `insteadOf`, `pushInsteadOf`, `remote.*.pushurl`, and every `[include]` or
//!    worktree-config file at once.
//! 3. **Destination binding** ([`crate::git_transport`]): the resolved remote URL must equal the
//!    URL we named, and every https leg the transport builds must target that same URL. A rewrite
//!    from any source — config, commondir, a future mechanism — fails before a request exists.
//!
//! Branch-scoping (the token names one ref) bounds a token that leaks anyway: it can replay a push
//! to that one ref of that one repository until it expires. That is bounded authority, not zero.
//!
//! The push runs in the CONTAINER (or, on the interim host path, after the container that ran the
//! agent has exited), so no live agent parses the seller key — an unknown git-parser bug at push time
//! hits a process that is already the sandbox, not the host. The caller reaps the agent's process
//! group before the push, so nothing can re-plant the config in the window.
//!
//! ## What the push sends (C6)
//! The push source is the gated commit OBJECT, not the local branch name: the refspec is
//! `<gated oid>:refs/heads/<branch>`. A survivor that moves the local branch under the push changes
//! nothing about the bytes sent. The remote's status report must name exactly that ref, and the
//! remote's advertisement is then read back over a new connection and must show the ref at the gated
//! oid. The local ref is never re-resolved after the push. See
//! [`crate::git_transport::push_branch_with_header`].
//!
//! The completion gate and the execution sentinel are NOT re-implemented here: the delivery commit is
//! produced by [`crate::seller_git::snapshot_delivery_at`], which runs the §19 gate (refusing an empty
//! tree) and force-stages the sentinel. This module provisions, runs the agent, gates, and pushes.
//!
//! ## One container, driven from inside (Task B9 + B2)
//! On the container delivery path — the default for `[sandbox] mode = "docker"` — the seller host
//! launches ONE container whose command is `maxplayer __deliver phase1 <inputs>`.
//! [`run_phase1_entry`] then, in order: reads the inputs and DELETES the file (C3, fail closed);
//! provisions the workdir; DRIVES the ACP agent itself through
//! [`crate::seller_exec::run_agent_with_retry`] under a pass-through policy (the container is the
//! sandbox — no nested docker), with an explicit environment allowlist (C4); gates and commits; reaps
//! every other process in the container (mandatory — see below); writes the [`AGENT_DONE_MARKER`];
//! obtains the push token per [`PushTokenSource`]; pushes with the gated oid as the expected oid (C6);
//! and writes the oid and the [`Phase1Outcome`] for the host. The host runs no git and no ACP: it
//! mints tokens (crypto), reads two small files, and publishes the kind-3403. The entry runs only
//! where the host set [`CONTAINER_DELIVERY_ENV`] on the `docker run`; a developer who runs it on a
//! host by hand is refused before anything happens.
//!
//! ## The exchange directory
//! The host owns a per-job directory (mode `0700`, outside the agent-writable workdir) and mounts it
//! at [`CONTAINER_EXCHANGE_DIR`]. The host writes [`PHASE1_INPUTS_FILE`] (mode `0600`) before launch
//! and, in the fresh-after-agent mode, [`PUSH_TOKEN_FILE`] (mode `0600`) after the marker appears. The
//! container writes [`AGENT_DONE_MARKER`], [`DELIVERY_OID_FILE`] and [`OUTCOME_FILE`].
//!
//! Every file one side reads out of this directory goes through [`read_exchange_file`]: the open
//! follows no symlink and never blocks, the OPENED descriptor must be a regular file, and the read
//! stops at a small per-file cap ([`EXCHANGE_MARKER_MAX_BYTES`] and its siblings). The host polls the
//! marker WHILE the agent lives, so without this a job could plant, under the marker's name, a FIFO
//! (a following, blocking read parks the host past every deadline check) or a symlink to `/dev/zero`
//! (the host reads until allocation fails) — no container escape and no nonce needed. The host's
//! writes refuse any entry that already exists at the name, a symlink included.
//!
//! ⚠ Who can read what, and when. The container runs every process as ONE uid (`--user`, no
//! capabilities), so the agent and the orchestrator share file permissions inside the container. The
//! contract therefore rests on TIME, not on modes: the inputs file (`job_hash`, and in long-lived mode
//! the token) is deleted BEFORE the agent is spawned, and the fresh token file is written only AFTER
//! the agent and every other process are dead and the marker — which carries a nonce only the
//! orchestrator learned from the deleted inputs — has been verified by the host. Three things hold
//! that up, and none of them is a file the job could write:
//! - the host's reads of the exchange files are hardened ([`read_exchange_file`], above), so a live
//!   job cannot park or exhaust the host through the channel;
//! - the reap is MANDATORY ([`reap_other_processes`]): it always runs, and a `/proc` that cannot be
//!   listed or a survivor that will not die fails the delivery closed. It is gated on the environment
//!   the host set at `docker run` ([`CONTAINER_DELIVERY_ENV`]), read once before the agent exists —
//!   never on a sentinel file, which a root job could unlink to skip it;
//! - a seat whose daemon runs as uid 0 puts the job at root INSIDE the container, where this same-uid
//!   boundary is weakest, so container delivery is not the default there: it takes an explicit
//!   `[sandbox] container_delivery = true` (`SandboxConfig::container_delivery_enabled`).
//!
//! What is NOT bounded: the same-uid memory boundary. A job process that is alive at the same time
//! as the orchestrator shares its uid, and until the two run as different uids (issue #980) the
//! defence is that no such process survives the reap. The token is branch-scoped in any case, so a
//! leak can write nothing but the seller's own delivery branch — replayable authority on one ref for
//! the token's lifetime: a bounded harm, not none.
