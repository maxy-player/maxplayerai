//! Container-side delivery orchestration (Track B): the git steps that must NOT run against a
//! repository the job agent could write.
//!
//! ## The exploit this closes
//! The job agent has full write access to its workdir, INCLUDING `workdir/.git/config`. libgit2
//! applies `url.<other>.insteadOf = <relay>` rewrite rules from the config of the repository that
//! RUNS an operation — at connect time, for `remote_anonymous` too. [`crate::git_transport`] empties
//! the global/XDG/system config search paths so no ambient config is read, but a repo-LOCAL
//! `.git/config` in the agent's own workdir is still consulted. So if the seller host opens the
//! agent's workdir and pushes, the agent's planted `insteadOf` silently redirects that push — with
//! the seller's signed NIP-98 token — to a host the agent chose. Test:
//! `tests/hostile_local_git_config.rs`.
//!
//! ## The fix: neutralise the config, then push
//! Before the push, [`crate::seller_git::neutralize_push_config`] REPLACES the workdir's `.git/config`
//! with a fixed, minimal, redirect-free file (shipped as the interim host fix; the container push
//! reuses it — one definition). That is a whole-file replacement, not a targeted edit, so it removes
//! every redirect knob at once — `insteadOf`, `pushInsteadOf`, `remote.*.pushurl`, and any
//! `[include]`/`[includeIf]` or worktree-config file the agent could have pointed at — rather than a
//! fragile blocklist. [`push_delivery`] then pushes from the workdir: the config has no rewrite rule,
//! so the token can only go to the URL we named. Branch-scoping (the token names one ref) is the
//! second layer if a token leaks anyway.
//!
//! The push runs in the CONTAINER (or, on the interim host path, after the container that ran the
//! agent has exited), so no live agent parses the seller key — an unknown git-parser bug at push time
//! hits a process that is already the sandbox, not the host. The caller reaps the agent's process
//! group before the push, so nothing can re-plant the config in the window.
//!
//! The completion gate and the execution sentinel are NOT re-implemented here: the delivery commit is
//! produced by [`crate::seller_git::snapshot_delivery_at`], which runs the §19 gate (refusing an empty
//! tree) and force-stages the sentinel. This module provisions, runs the agent, gates, and pushes.
//!
//! ## One container, driven from inside (Task B9 + B2)
//! Behind `[sandbox] container_delivery = true` the seller host launches ONE container whose command
//! is `maxplayer __deliver phase1 <inputs>`. [`run_phase1_entry`] then, in order: reads the inputs and
//! DELETES the file (C3, fail closed); provisions the workdir; DRIVES the ACP agent itself through
//! [`crate::seller_exec::run_agent_with_retry`] under a pass-through policy (the container is the
//! sandbox — no nested docker), with an explicit environment allowlist (C4); gates and commits; reaps
//! every other process in the container; writes the [`AGENT_DONE_MARKER`]; obtains the push token per
//! [`PushTokenSource`]; pushes with the gated oid as the expected oid (C6); and writes the oid and the
//! [`Phase1Outcome`] for the host. The host runs no git and no ACP: it mints tokens (crypto), reads
//! two small files, and publishes the kind-3403.
//!
//! ## The exchange directory
//! The host owns a per-job directory (mode `0700`, outside the agent-writable workdir) and mounts it
//! at [`CONTAINER_EXCHANGE_DIR`]. The host writes [`PHASE1_INPUTS_FILE`] (mode `0600`) before launch
//! and, in the fresh-after-agent mode, [`PUSH_TOKEN_FILE`] (mode `0600`) after the marker appears. The
//! container writes [`AGENT_DONE_MARKER`], [`DELIVERY_OID_FILE`] and [`OUTCOME_FILE`].
//!
//! ⚠ Who can read what, and when. The container runs every process as ONE uid (`--user`, no
//! capabilities), so the agent and the orchestrator share file permissions inside the container. The
//! contract therefore rests on TIME, not on modes: the inputs file (`job_hash`, and in long-lived mode
//! the token) is deleted BEFORE the agent is spawned, and the fresh token file is written only AFTER
//! the agent and every other process are dead and the marker — which carries a nonce only the
//! orchestrator learned from the deleted inputs — has been verified by the host. A job process that
//! survives cannot forge the marker without the nonce, and the token is branch-scoped in any case, so a
//! leak pushes nothing but the seller's own delivery branch.
