//! Packaged buyer home under `~/.maxplayer` (or `MAXPLAYER_HOME`).
//!
//! First-run bootstrap writes working defaults: a REAL minibits mint, maxplayer-relay, budget caps,
//! autogen key (`0600`), and an empty `wallet/` dir. The secret key is never returned.
//!
//! # Layered configuration
//!
//! [`MaxplayerConfig`] resolves in three layers, later winning:
//!
//! 1. **built-in defaults** — [`MaxplayerConfig::default`].
//! 2. **file** — `~/.maxplayer/config.toml` (if present). Absent fields fall back to the defaults;
//!    unknown fields refuse (`deny_unknown_fields`). The single-mint legacy `mint_url = "…"` key
//!    folds into `accepted_mints`.
//! 3. **environment** — `MAXPLAYER_*` variables. Every field is reachable: uppercase the field path,
//!    prefix `MAXPLAYER_`, join nested fields with `__` (double underscore). Comma-separated for lists.
//!
//! The **entire `MAXPLAYER_` prefix is reserved** for this config: every `MAXPLAYER_*` variable must map
//! to a [`MaxplayerConfig`] field or be a known operational seam ([`RESERVED_ENV_VARS`], e.g.
//! `MAXPLAYER_HOME`). An unrecognized `MAXPLAYER_*` variable is refused fail-closed — never silently
//! ignored — so do not repurpose the prefix for unrelated environment variables. A single `_` where a
//! nested `__` was meant (`MAXPLAYER_SANDBOX_RO_PATHS` vs `MAXPLAYER_SANDBOX__RO_PATHS`) reads as an
//! unknown top-level field and refuses; the refusal names the offending variable and this rule.
//!
//! The typed struct is the single in-process representation — only its *construction* is layered
//! (the one seam is [`bootstrap`] / [`reload_config`], both routed through the env overlay). Every
//! layer fails closed: an unknown or malformed key refuses with the offending key named, never a
//! silent default.
//!
//! ## Env mapping
//!
//! | Field | Variable |
//! |-------|----------|
//! | `relay_url` | `MAXPLAYER_RELAY_URL` |
//! | `accepted_mints` (list) | `MAXPLAYER_ACCEPTED_MINTS=a,b` |
//! | `per_job_budget_sats` | `MAXPLAYER_PER_JOB_BUDGET_SATS` |
//! | `extra_mints` (list) | `MAXPLAYER_EXTRA_MINTS=a,b` |
//! | `allow_real_mints` | `MAXPLAYER_ALLOW_REAL_MINTS` |
//! | `profile.name` | `MAXPLAYER_PROFILE__NAME` |
//! | `seller.rate_sats` | `MAXPLAYER_SELLER__RATE_SATS` |
//! | `seller.agent_command` (list) | `MAXPLAYER_SELLER__AGENT_COMMAND=claude,--flag` |
//! | `seller_announce.command` (list) | `MAXPLAYER_SELLER_ANNOUNCE__COMMAND=…` |
//! | `telemetry.mirror_file` | `MAXPLAYER_TELEMETRY__MIRROR_FILE` |
//! | `seller_heartbeat.interval_secs` | `MAXPLAYER_SELLER_HEARTBEAT__INTERVAL_SECS` |
//! | `seller_preflight.boot_push_preflight` | `MAXPLAYER_SELLER_PREFLIGHT__BOOT_PUSH_PREFLIGHT` |
//! | `buyer.hop_fee_buffer_multiplier` | `MAXPLAYER_BUYER__HOP_FEE_BUFFER_MULTIPLIER` |
//! | `contribution.allowed_paths` (list) | `MAXPLAYER_CONTRIBUTION__ALLOWED_PATHS=…` |
//!
//! List fields comma-split only for the paths in [`LIST_ENV_KEYS`]. The `agents` map is file-only
//! via env: its keys are dynamic, so a nested `argv` list path cannot be pre-registered for
//! splitting. `MAXPLAYER_`-prefixed operational/test seams ([`RESERVED_ENV_VARS`], e.g. `MAXPLAYER_HOME`)
//! are excluded from the config layer.
//!
//! ## Minimal env-only boot (file-less container)
//!
//! With no `config.toml`, the built-in defaults already boot a **buyer** (real minibits mint, maxplayer-relay,
//! budget caps). A **seller** additionally needs the seller table, whose minimal env set is:
//! `MAXPLAYER_SELLER__AGENT_COMMAND`, `MAXPLAYER_SELLER__RATE_SATS`, `MAXPLAYER_SELLER__GIT_REMOTE`. The key is
//! still auto-generated on bootstrap (or supplied out-of-band); `NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY` handling is
//! unchanged and never read here.

# USE DOCKER. It is the only mode with a kernel boundary and egress

# published for dev builds — set `image` to a locally-built tag (e.g.
# "maxplayer-sandbox:latest") to override, or the default will fail to pull.
#   [sandbox]

#   proxy_port_range = "9100-9199"     # REQUIRED once network is set; size it >= [seller] slots
#   runtime = "runsc"                  # gVisor - LINUX ONLY
#   # image = "ghcr.io/you/custom:tag" # ONLY to run a fully-custom image; NOT a version pin
#   # image = "maxplayer-sandbox:latest" # LOCAL DEV: your locally-built tag (default GHCR ref is unpublished for dev)
#   # forward_env = ["MY_AGENT_TOKEN"] # extra env names, atop the built-in auth allowlist
#
# Option B - docker on macOS. Docker Desktop cannot load runsc, so OMIT the
# runtime line; the platform VM is the boundary. Otherwise identical to A.
#   [sandbox]
#   mode = "docker"
#   network = "maxplayer-jobs"

# LINK THE MODEL ACCOUNT FIRST. Maxplayer does not authenticate cursor, claude
# or codex - the adapter starts the vendor CLI and that CLI must already be
# logged in, as the seller service user. Full walkthrough, per provider:
# docs/SELLER-QUICKSTART.md "3a. Link your model account".
#
# THE CREDENTIAL DOES NOT CROSS INTO THE CONTAINER. A container inherits no
# home directory and no macOS Keychain, so a `claude /login` credential is
# unreachable inside the container. `doctor` still passes - it runs no agent
# turn - but the pre-advertise probe runs INSIDE the container and FAILS, so the
# seat never advertises rather than advertising and failing every job. A seat
# that will not advertise under docker is usually THIS. Put a token in the
# DAEMON's own environment - for claude, CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN from
# `claude setup-token`.
#
# Option C - launcher, ONLY for a Linux box that cannot run docker. Weaker: no
# kernel boundary, no egress containment. Full bwrap example: docs/DOCKER.md
#   [sandbox]
#   mode = "launcher"
#   launcher = ["bwrap", "--unshare-all", "--die-with-parent", "..."]
