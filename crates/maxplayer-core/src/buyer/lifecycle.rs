//!
//! - [`select_awardable_claim`] — never auto-award a claim the buyer cannot pay (price/mint).
//! - [`award_with_reservation`] — reserve BEFORE publishing; a refused reservation publishes
//!   nothing and (by [`BuyerStore::reserve`]'s zero-write guarantee) leaves no row.
//! - [`settle_after_pay`] — flip `reserved → spent` ONLY after the budget append + wallet melt
//!   have landed (the #123/#126 ordering obligation on [`BuyerStore::convert_to_spent`]).
//! - [`classify_disposition`] — a reserved job's reconcile verdict; an ambiguous payment is kept,
//!   never auto-released.
