//! The persistent per-home **maxplayer buyer** (step 1 of the stateful-buyer design, #127).
//!
//! One daemon owns a home. It takes an exclusive OS lock on `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/buyer.lock`
//! (a second daemon on the same home fails closed), opens the CDK wallet and the
//! Nostr identity behind serialized in-process actors, opens the durable state DB
//! `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/buyer.sqlite`, and serves a small JSON-RPC surface over the
//! user-only Unix socket `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/buyer.sock`. Every other process is a thin,
//! stateless [`client`] over that socket.
//!
//! This module is deliberately the *shell*: the boundary that makes financial
//! authority singular and durable. The reservation ledger, auto-award, lifecycle
//! engine, and crash-safe payment saga are later phases that build on this state
//! home.
//!
//! This is the **buyer** daemon. If a seller daemon is ever built, a shared
//! buyer/seller core can be extracted then — do not generalize preemptively. The
//! structure (this module, the `wallet` feature flag) is under reassessment in
//! issue #133.
//!
//! Concurrency is 1: the queue behind each actor — not SQLite locking — is the
//! in-process concurrency boundary, mirroring the home lock across processes.

/// Resolve award attempts a prior run left open (#322) — runs as the first act of the reconcile
/// task and again on each of its ticks (ONE task, so two sweeps can never overlap), keeping the
/// boot instance off the socket's 10s readiness budget and bounding a lost `OK`'s stall to
/// minutes, not the daemon's lifetime.
///
/// Three work sets, all from durable state:
///
/// - **Heal**: attempts CONFIRMED public whose `awards` row is missing (the crash window between
///   the relay's ack and `record_award`). Healed through the chokepoint's repair arm — which
///   re-holds the funds `record_award` alone would leave dangling (the reconcile pass may have
///   released them while the row was missing; an awards row without its reservation is invisible
///   to the delivery watcher and over-states `available`).
/// - **Finish**: attempts REFUSED whose reservation is still held (the crash window between the
///   refusal mark and its release) — the chokepoint's RefusedTerminal arm releases them.
/// - **Resolve**: attempts still PENDING. Before the offer deadline the pinned bytes are re-sent
///   (transmission OUTSIDE the money lock; verdict folded in through the chokepoint — an
///   already-stored event acks as `duplicate:`, so the send doubles as the probe). Past the
///   deadline nothing is transmitted — [`resolve_expired_attempt`] probes by id and terminalizes
///   only past the pay window, only without deliveries, and only under the money lock, gated on
///   winning the refusal transition.
///
/// Concurrency-safe by construction: every money decision happens under `money_lock` — inside
/// the chokepoint, or in [`terminalize_absent_attempt`] under the caller's guard — so this can
/// run alongside the serving RPCs and re-armed auto-award tasks.
