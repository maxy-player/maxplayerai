//! The seller's harness registry: which agent harnesses this ONE node can run, and which one a
//! given job dispatches to.
//!
//! A node lists the harnesses it enables in `[seller] agents` (order = preference); each name is a
//! preset from [`crate::agent_presets`], so the same `claude|cursor|codex|<custom>` vocabulary the
//! CLI accepts is the vocabulary the wire advertises. The registry is resolved ONCE at boot —
//! every listed preset is checked for a launchable adapter and each gets its own PASS/FAIL verdict,
//! so a missing adapter is a named line rather than a runtime surprise mid-job.
//!
//! Two rules the rest of the node leans on:
//!
//! - **Advertise only what is dispatchable.** [`AgentRegistry::advertised`] is exactly the set
//!   [`AgentRegistry::dispatch`] can serve, so a buyer reading the wire and the node choosing a
//!   harness can never disagree. A raw `--agent-argv` seller carries no preset label, so it
//!   advertises nothing — there is no honest harness name to publish.
//! - **A named request is exact or nothing.** A job requesting harness `X` dispatches to `X` or is
//!   not served; there is no nearest-match fallback, because silently running a job on a harness
//!   the buyer did not ask for is the failure this registry exists to prevent.
//!
//! How many awarded jobs run at once is governed by the homogeneous node-level `[seller] slots`
//! (see [`crate::home::SellerConfig::slots`]) — every slot runs whichever harness the job asked for.
//! Issue #378 removed the per-entry `{ name, slots }` pool count: `agents` is a plain list of harness
//! names, and this homogeneous node-level count is the only concurrency knob.
