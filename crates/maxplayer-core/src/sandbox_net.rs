//! Network containment for a docker job (#797): deny the seller's LAN and the seller's own host
//! services, leave the public internet open.
//!
//! The container runs a stranger's code. `docs/SANDBOXING.md` §1 reasons about egress as
//! internet-shaped — docs pages, registries, obscure hosts — and that argument assumes the only thing
//! worth stealing is a durable credential. It is not. A job on a bridge network can also reach
//! whatever the seller runs locally: a Lightning node's REST port, a database, an admin UI bound to
//! `0.0.0.0`. That is a different and worse target, and nothing in the credential design touches it.
//!
//! ── The rules live in the job's OWN network namespace ────────────────────────────────────────────
//! Containment is installed *into the namespace the job's traffic cannot leave*, not into the host's
//! firewall. A short-lived sidecar container joins the namespace, appends these rules, and exits; the
//! job then joins the same namespace and starts with the rules already in force. Two consequences,
//! and both are the point:
//!
//!   * **Containment lifetime == job lifetime.** Nothing outlives the job and nothing has to be
//!     reapplied after a reboot, a docker restart that recreates the bridge, or a `nixos-rebuild`.
//!     The state "configured but not enforced" — the state a host-side ruleset can silently drift
//!     into while a job is running — is not representable.
//!   * **No root on the seller's box, ever.** `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is scoped to a throwaway namespace held
//!     by the sidecar. The job itself is launched `--user <uid>:<gid> --cap-drop ALL
//!     --security-opt no-new-privileges`, so it has an empty capability *bounding* set and cannot
//!     alter or even read these rules.
//!
//! ── One chain, because a namespace has no routed/host-terminating split ──────────────────────────
//! A host-side policy has to filter in two places, because container traffic divides by destination
//! before any filter chain sees it: traffic to the LAN or internet is ROUTED (`FORWARD`, which docker
//! hooks via `DOCKER-USER`), while traffic to an address the host itself owns is NOT routed and
//! terminates in `INPUT`. A deny written only into `DOCKER-USER` installs cleanly, reports success,
//! and blocks nothing on the host-services path.
//!
//! Inside the job's own namespace that split does not exist: **everything the job sends is locally
//! generated, so all of it traverses `OUTPUT`.** One chain covers both halves.
//!
//! ── Destination-scoped, never interface-scoped ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! Every rule matches on `-d <cidr>` and no rule names an interface. This is deliberate and it is
//! what makes the sidecar safe to run before the namespace has finished being plumbed: the rules live
//! in the namespace and apply *whenever* an interface appears. A host-side policy could not have this
//! property — its rules were `-i <bridge>` and therefore depended on the bridge already existing,
//! which is the same fragility that made a docker restart able to silently un-contain a seat.
//!
//! ── Order is load-bearing, and the pinhole is the reason ─────────────────────────────────────────
//! Credential containment (#647, PR #807) forwards `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointing at a per-job proxy
//! on the host, reached at the namespace's gateway address. **That gateway is itself inside a denied
//! range** — `172.x.0.1` falls in `172.16.0.0/12` on a Linux bridge, and Docker Desktop's
//! host-gateway `192.168.65.254` falls in `192.168.0.0/16`. So the breadth of the LAN deny is both
//! the feature and the hazard: the same rule that covers the seller's host services also covers the
//! one host service the job legitimately needs.
//!
//! The pinhole ACCEPT must therefore precede the range drops. Measured, appending it *after* them
//! leaves it inert — iptables takes the first match, the drop wins, and every job silently loses
//! access to its model while the ruleset looks correct.
//!
//! `169.254.169.254` — the cloud metadata endpoint — gets NO pinhole and is dropped by a rule of its
//! own, ahead of everything. It is already inside the denied `169.254.0.0/16`, so the standalone rule
//! adds no coverage today; it exists so that a future link-local exception cannot silently take the
//! metadata endpoint with it, and so the drop has its own log line.
//!
//! ── What is deliberately NOT denied ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! Loopback. Docker's embedded DNS resolver lives at `127.0.0.11` inside the namespace, so denying
//! `127.0.0.0/8` would break name resolution for every job. Nothing else answers on the job's
//! loopback, so the range carries no reachable target worth denying.
