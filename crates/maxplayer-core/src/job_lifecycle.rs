//! Buyer job lifecycle over the maxplayer relay (kinds offer / feedback / result).
//!
//! - [`post_job`] publishes a real offer-kind offer (targeted p-tag = documented default).
//! - [`get_job`] reads claim/result state from relay events (not local invent).
//! - [`accept_claim`] records a local pay-bind for
//!   [`authorize_pay`](crate::authorize_pay) (seller / result / commit) — written BEFORE the
//!   publish, so a crash cannot leave a public accept with no bind — then publishes an
//!   `accepted` ACCEPT (kind-3406 via [`accept_draft`]). [`prepare_award_async`] signs the
//!   SELECTION as a kind-3405 AWARD — separate kinds, so a reader can tell a pay-bind from a
//!   choice of seller. Claims/results themselves remain relay-truth.
//!
//! Local bind under `~/.maxplayer/jobs/<job_id>.json` is accept-state only.
