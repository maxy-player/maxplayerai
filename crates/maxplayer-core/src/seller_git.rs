//! Seller-side git — ALL in-process via libgit2; no system `git` on any product path.
//!
//! Base fetch, fork checkout, and delivery push run through [`crate::git_transport`]'s rustls
//! smart-HTTP subtransport, which injects the seller's NIP-98 `Authorization` on relay-git requests.
//! The agent edits files in the job workdir but never commits; at delivery the daemon snapshots the
//! final tree into ONE commit under the delivery identity via [`snapshot_delivery`] (git2 only, no
//! `git` subprocess) and pushes that.
//!
//! ## Why the old scrub machinery is gone (and this is safe)
//! The previous implementation shelled out to `git` and had to defend against ambient config: empty
//! `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`, `protocol.*.allow=never`, scrubbed
//! `GIT_SSH*`/`insteadOf`. In-process git2 needs NONE of that:
//! - **Ambient-config immunity:** the transport layer ([`crate::git_transport`]) empties libgit2's
//!   global/XDG/system config search path at first use, so no ambient git config is consulted on
//!   any leg. Only a repository-local config is read at all.
//! - **Repository-local config, in a workdir the job wrote:** libgit2 applies `url.*.insteadOf` from
//!   the config of the repository that runs the operation, and it finds that config through
//!   `.git/commondir` when that file exists. Three layers close this, in order:
//!   [`assert_plain_repo_layout`] refuses a `.git` that is a gitfile or a symlink, a `.git/commondir`
//!   entry, and a `.git/config` that is not a regular file; [`neutralize_push_config`] then replaces
//!   `.git/config` with a fixed minimal file; and [`crate::git_transport`] binds every leg to the
//!   URL the caller named, so a rewrite from any remaining source fails before a request exists.
//! - **Transport allowlist:** every entry asserts [`assert_allowed_repo_locator`] and only `https`
//!   is registered as a subtransport — `ext:`/`file:`/`ssh:` are refused before any remote exists.
//! - **Key hygiene:** the seller secret signs the NIP-98 event in-process only — never on argv,
//!   never in child env, no subprocess.

// --- Off-runtime wrappers for the async seller node -------------------------------------------
//
// Everything above is synchronous libgit2 — and the push additionally drives blocking HTTP through
// the smart subtransport registered in `git_transport`. libgit2 has no async form, so an async client
// would not help: the C call owns the thread for its duration either way. The only correct shape is
// to run it on a blocking thread.
//
// This matters more than "don't block the executor" usually does. The seller node runs on a
// CURRENT-THREAD runtime, where the single thread drives futures, the I/O driver AND the timer wheel.
// A blocking call there does not merely delay other work — it stops time. A slow or hung push takes
// the heartbeat tick, the relay-stall watchdog and every relay notification down with it, at 0% CPU,
// with nothing logged. Long-standing (`origin/main` has the same shape) but only visible on a host
// where pushes hang; on a fast network the window is milliseconds.
