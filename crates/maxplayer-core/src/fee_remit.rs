//! Paying the accrued platform fee to the platform's Lightning address — **the one remit path in
//! the product**, and its first seller-fee payment code (operator melts existed before it).
//!
//! ## Who calls this, and when
//!
//! [`remit`] has exactly three callers, and all three are named here so a grep confirms it:
//!
//! 1. **The seller node's collect path** (`seller_node::run`, the `Collected::New` arm of the
//!    receipt write), through [`remit_live_best_effort`] → [`remit_best_effort`] under
//!    [`RemitTrigger::Collect`]. This is the mechanism, and the fast path: a fee the seller had to
//!    remember to pay would not be a fee, so the node remits as a consequence of collecting, normally
//!    within a second of the sale. It fires only when a receipt was journaled **New** — never on a
//!    replayed wrap (`Duplicate`), never on an error — and it is **best-effort**: whatever happens
//!    here is logged and journaled; it cannot fail the collect, delay the job being marked paid, or
//!    change what the seller received.
//! 2. **The seller node's retry tick** (`seller_node::run`, an arm of the live loop's `select!`),
//!    through the same two functions under [`RemitTrigger::Retry`]. This is the safety net behind
//!    the fast path (stage 2a, addendum 2): a failed remittance retries on the node's own clock — base
//!    30 s, doubling to a 30-minute cap, full jitter — for as long as the node runs, and stops with
//!    the loop. [`RemitBackoff`] is the pacing; [`RemitFlight`] keeps the two node paths to one
//!    attempt in flight.
//! 3. **`maxplayer seller fees remit`** (`crates/maxplayer/src/seller_fees.rs`): inspection (the
//!    default dry run resolves, quotes, prints the plan and the recent attempts, and moves nothing),
//!    recovery (`--confirm` forces an attempt now, for an operator whose automatic path has been
//!    failing), and reconciliation (an interrupted attempt is settled or released against the mint).
//!
//! The `[platform_fee] auto_remit` switch ([`crate::home::PlatformFeeConfig`]) turns BOTH node
//! paths off — the collect path's attempt and the retry tick — and does not touch accrual;
//! `--confirm` pays regardless. There is no startup sweep and no other call site. The node's two
//! attempts run on threads the node owns and drains on shutdown (bounded); see `seller_node::run`.
//!
//! ## What one attempt does
//!
//! Reconcile any in-flight attempt first; read the unremitted balance; resolve
//! [`PLATFORM_FEE_ADDRESS`] over LNURL-pay ([`crate::lnurl_pay`], fail-closed) and refuse below its
//! minimum — the expected steady state for small sellers, not an error; probe the mint's melt fee
//! reserve on the gross and invoice the **net**, so the fee comes OUT of the accrued amount; journal
//! the plan (which pins the receipts, records this process as the row's owner under a lease, and
//! refuses a duplicate — the idempotency that makes two concurrent collects pay at most once); raise
//! the **payment quote** and check it against the hard [`MeltCeiling`] (refused ⇒ the planned row is
//! released, nothing spent); **prepare** the melt of that quote through
//! [`crate::wallet_ops::prepare_melt_payment_blocking`] — the wallet selects and reserves proofs in
//! its own database and states the SDK's proof-input fee and pre-melt swap fee, and the ceiling is
//! taken on the TOTAL (invoice + reserve + both fees; over ⇒ the prepared melt is cancelled locally
//! and the planned row released, nothing posted); pass the **pre-spend gate** — ONE compare-and-set
//! in the store advances the row `planned → spending` and BINDS that quote to it (only if still
//! planned, still ours, with more than [`SPEND_MARGIN`] of lease left at the clock read INSIDE the
//! store call; zero rows changed is a refusal, and the prepared melt is cancelled); then **confirm**
//! the prepared melt — the swap if one is required, then the melt request for exactly that quote, by
//! id — the same gated wallet `maxplayer wallet melt` uses (it honours `allow_real_mints`); it never
//! raises a second quote; settle. Every attempt that meant to pay is journaled with its outcome
//! (`fee_remit_attempts`), so a payout that keeps failing is visible in the read-out rather than
//! silent.
//!
//! ## The two invariants (stage 2a, addendum 3; the fence of addendum 4; the hold of addendum 6; the total bound of addendum 8)
//!
//! **Money hold (§1):** the seller never pays more than the fee it accrued — gross is the ceiling,
//! every cost of the payment comes out of it, and the ceiling is enforced at the moment of spending,
//! not estimated beforehand or regretted afterwards. The estimate at plan time is a plan; the quote
//! the wallet actually pays under is checked against `gross`, and a reserve that grew in between is
//! a refused, journaled, failed attempt with the balance intact. Since addendum 8 the bound is on the
//! **entire wallet debit**: the pinned CDK 0.17.2 wallet charges, on top of invoice + fee reserve, a
//! proof-input fee on the proofs it sends (`input_fee_ppk`, NUT-02) and — when its proofs do not fit
//! — the fee of a pre-melt swap it performs inside `confirm`; the delivered ceiling of rounds 1–6
//! saw neither (verdict B4 at 19f30d3). Now the melt is PREPARED before the fence — `prepare_melt`
//! selects and reserves proofs in the wallet's own store and exposes `input_fee`, `swap_fee` and
//! `requires_swap` (`melt/mod.rs:428–450`) while posting no proof-bearing or fee-bearing request
//! (it may fetch mint metadata/keysets, a GET; the swap `melt/saga/mod.rs:687–697` and the melt
//! request `:907–911` both live inside `confirm`) — and [`MeltCeiling::admits_confirmable`] is taken on
//! those four figures; over ⇒ `PreparedMelt::cancel` (`:817–831`, best-effort local compensation:
//! proofs back to Unspent, quote released) and the ordinary before-fence refusal (the planned row
//! is NOT written: it stays planned, unbound and ours, its receipts pinned; ONE `REFUSED before
//! spending` line naming the total, its parts and the ceiling; backoff continues and the next
//! attempt's reconciliation releases the row as our own earlier attempt and re-plans — addendum
//! 10 §2) — a fee refusal never leaves a bound Spending row held.
//!
//! **The fee model is CDK's, not the prepared display's (addendum 9).** The prepared `input_fee` is
//! an ESTIMATE — the fee on the split of invoice + reserve before that fee is added
//! (`melt/saga/mod.rs:383–387`). `confirm` swaps to a target of invoice + reserve + that estimate
//! (`:678`), receives exactly the target's denomination split, RECOMPUTES the input fee on that
//! split (`:704`) and refuses — after the swap has been paid — when the target does not cover
//! invoice + reserve + the actual fee (`:706–712`). So this module runs that arithmetic itself,
//! twice, before any fee-bearing effect: **planning** ([`plan_confirmable_invoice`]) searches down
//! from gross − reserve for the largest invoice whose post-swap arithmetic holds and whose worst
//! case (invoice + reserve + actual input fee + swap fee) fits the gross — none ⇒
//! [`Refusal::FeesDoNotFit`] — and re-checks the quote actually raised; **before the fence**
//! ([`confirm_would_succeed`]) the same check runs on the prepared figures and the keyset's
//! `input_fee_ppk` ([`crate::wallet_ops::MeltPreparation::input_fee_ppk`]) and refuses — prepared
//! melt cancelled, row released, one line — when the SDK would refuse after its swap or the actual
//! worst case exceeds the gross. After payment the SDK's `FinalizedMelt::fee_paid` (`:139–148`:
//! proofs sent − invoice − change) already CONTAINS the actual input fee beside the Lightning fee;
//! the actual debit is invoice + `fee_paid` + swap fee, counted once — the prepared estimate is
//! printed, never added. A failed post-payment balance read prints `unknown`, never a computed
//! figure.
//!
//! **Bound, disclosed not solved (addendum 9 §1.5):** the mint's fee metadata can change between
//! prepare and confirm, and the SDK takes no caller maximum into `confirm`. A change there can make
//! `confirm` fail after the swap (the swap fee is gone, the row is bound Spending and HELD by the
//! PAID-only rule below) or cost more than the arithmetic predicted (the `WARNING` line after
//! payment). No exploit is claimed or reproduced; no changing-fee mint was measured. Likewise
//! **owed**: a cancelled preparation whose SDK compensation itself failed can leave a local proof
//! reservation — `open_wallet_async` only constructs the wallet and CDK `recover_incomplete_sagas`
//! is not run on this path (a blanket recovery could replay a still-live payer's saga); a supported
//! recovery path is owed, not wired.
//!
//! The fee-bearing fake wallet — whose `confirm` models the swap output split, the swap fee charged
//! even when the melt then fails, the recomputed input fee, the post-swap refusal and the inclusive
//! `fee_paid` — and the regressions
//! `a_fee_bearing_payment_whose_prepared_input_fee_differs_from_the_actual_pays_once_and_the_wallet_loses_at_most_the_gross`
//! (one swap, one melt, the wallet measured),
//! `a_fee_bearing_schedule_whose_prepared_figures_fit_but_post_swap_arithmetic_does_not_is_refused_before_the_fence`
//! (wallet delta 0, no swap, no melt, row released),
//! `a_fee_bearing_total_that_exceeds_the_gross_by_the_fee_is_refused_before_any_swap_or_melt`,
//! `fee_aware_planning_sizes_the_invoice_so_a_fee_bearing_payment_fits_without_reserve_slack`
//! (invoice 13, not 14), `fees_that_can_never_fit_are_refused_at_planning_not_at_payment` and
//! `a_failed_balance_read_after_a_fee_bearing_payment_prints_unknown_and_no_false_warning` hold
//! it; the reserve-grew case `a_reserve_that_grows_between_estimate_and_payment_is_refused_before_spending`
//! stands.
//!
//! **Ownership (§2), as the tests in this module prove it:** a row is paid only by the process that
//! planned it, only through the fence — [`SellerStore::admit_remittance_spend`], which two
//! processes cannot both pass — and only under the ONE quote the fence bound to it: the payer never
//! raises a second quote for a row it holds, and a quote it has not raised cannot be spoken for.
//! While that row is in flight — `planned` or `spending` — no second remittance against the same
//! balance can be planned by anyone: [`SellerStore::plan_remittance`] refuses inside its own
//! transaction, and a partial unique index refuses underneath it; neither predicate has a time
//! term. Every release is a conditional transition carrying its reason's predicate
//! ([`ReleaseOn`]): zero rows changed means the row moved under the releasing process, which then
//! holds. A `planned` row (fence not yet passed: nothing spent against it, and once released its
//! owner's fence changes zero rows) is released by another process only when its invoice's quote
//! is FAILED or UNPAID and expired, or its owner's lease of [`REMIT_LEASE`] has run out — never on
//! a live UNPAID alone, because UNPAID means "not yet", not "abandoned"; a planned row whose lease
//! ran down while its owner paused is refused by the owner's own fence, which reads the clock
//! inside the store's lock (`an_owner_whose_lease_ran_down_while_it_paused_is_refused_by_its_own_fence`;
//! released-then-refused: `an_owner_that_outlives_its_lease_is_released_and_its_fence_then_changes_zero_rows`,
//! `an_owner_paused_after_its_quote_and_past_its_lease_is_released_and_never_pays_that_quote`);
//! and a release decided on a stale planned snapshot changes zero rows once the owner's fence has
//! landed (`a_release_decided_on_a_stale_planned_snapshot_cannot_revoke_a_later_admission`).
//!
//! A `spending` row (fence passed, a quote bound: its owner may be mid-melt) **is released by
//! nobody, on no clock.** It settles when the mint reports its BOUND quote, asked by id, PAID; on
//! anything else — UNPAID however long past its expiry, FAILED, PENDING, UNKNOWN, a quote the wallet
//! does not know — it is HELD, and its receipts with it, until the mint says PAID or an operator
//! decides (no override exists in this round). **We do not infer terminality from a clock**, and
//! not from the mint's FAILED either, because the inspected CDK 0.17.2 mint implementation
//! (checksum-pinned source, read in the round-4 and round-5 verdicts — the implementation this
//! wallet is built on, not a measurement of whichever server a configured mint URL reaches) pays an
//! UNPAID *or FAILED* quote with no expiry check, and the wallet's own request, once past
//! `prepare_melt`, re-checks nothing: a
//! payment prepared before the quote expired can land after any observation a second process makes.
//! A release on "expired" or "FAILED" would therefore make the same gross payable twice
//! (`a_payment_prepared_before_expiry_cannot_be_doubled_by_a_release_after_it` schedules exactly
//! that ordering — A paused inside its payment after its last local check, the quote expiring, B
//! held with funds for a second payment in the same wallet — and counts one debit;
//! `a_bound_quote_expired_past_the_margin_is_held_and_its_owner_refuses_to_pay_it`,
//! `a_spending_row_is_not_released_when_its_lease_expires_and_its_owner_pays_exactly_once`,
//! `a_spending_row_is_reconciled_by_its_bound_quote_not_by_an_expired_estimate`,
//! `a_spending_rows_bound_quote_decides_its_release_on_the_full_path` — whose FAILED arm has the
//! mint pay the FAILED quote — and the table
//! `a_spending_row_is_never_released_by_reconciliation_only_settled`). What "at most one debit"
//! rests on is the exclusion: a second attempt is never admitted while a bound spending row
//! exists — at two boundaries. The ordinary one is RECONCILIATION: every `remit` run first finds the
//! in-flight row and, when it is SPENDING with a quote bound and the mint's answer about that quote
//! is anything but PAID, returns [`Refusal::SpendingHeld`] before it plans anything (this is where
//! B stops in (b1), (b2), (d) and the delayed-confirm test; a PLANNED row in flight is a different
//! case — (a)'s B returns [`Refusal::HeldByOwner`], (c)'s B releases the expired-lease row and pays
//! its own quote, (B2)'s B returns [`Refusal::RowChangedUnderMe`]). Behind it is the STORE:
//! [`SellerStore::plan_remittance`] refuses a second plan with `PlanRefused::InFlight` inside its own
//! `IMMEDIATE` transaction while any planned-or-spending row exists — the race-closing layer, reached
//! when two runs both saw no row (`two_racing_attempts_against_the_same_balance_record_exactly_one_remittance`)
//! and exercised directly, on B's own connection while A is paused inside its payment, in
//! `a_payment_prepared_before_expiry_cannot_be_doubled_by_a_release_after_it`. It does not rest on
//! when a quote dies. The cost is named, not hidden: a melt the mint
//! genuinely failed leaves the row held and every later remittance refused until an operator acts
//! (owed as later work; the CLI exits 3 and prints one `HELD:` line naming the row, the quote, the
//! mint's answer and the pinned sats). The owner's own reconciliation of its own `planned` row may
//! release on UNPAID: a process runs at most one attempt at a time ([`RemitFlight`] in the node; one
//! shot for the command), so its earlier attempt is over and, the fence never having been passed,
//! spent nothing. Its own `spending` row gets no such exception.
//!
//! **What the two-process tests prove, and their bound:** two processes, each on its own store
//! connection, debit an accrued balance at most once under every interleaving they schedule —
//! pauses after the plan, after the quote, after the fence, inside the payment after the wallet's
//! last local check, and between a release decision and its write; the lease and the quote expiring
//! while paused; distinct invoices; actual melts counted; the fake mint accepting UNPAID or FAILED
//! quotes regardless of expiry, as the inspected CDK 0.17.2 implementation does. What each shares
//! is stated per test, not assumed. One fake mint (the quote registry): (a), (b1), (b2), (c), (B2),
//! (d) and the delayed-confirm test. One effects clock handed from A to B: (b2), (c), (B2) and the
//! delayed-confirm test — (a), (b1) and (d) leave each process its own clock. One fake wallet (one
//! proof pool both processes select from): the delayed-confirm test only; the single-process
//! fee-bearing tests of addendum 8 each own a pool of their own. The older (b)/(c) cases and the
//! node's 2b test script the mint's answer on one process instead of reading a shared registry.
//! They do not run a real mint or a real wallet, and
//! `a_release_decided_on_a_stale_planned_snapshot…` moves its command clock (401) independently of
//! its effects clock (100) to force the SQL ordering — a synthetic time model, not a claim about
//! how a mint's clock behaves.
//!
//! Every effect on the world goes through [`RemitEffects`], so the decision logic is tested against
//! scripted effects without a network or a mint. Exactly one method of that trait spends:
//! [`RemitEffects::confirm_melt`] (on a melt [`RemitEffects::prepare_melt`] prepared and bounded).

/// Order of operations, and why:
/// 1. Reconcile any in-flight row first — a payment may be in flight from an interrupted run, and
///    nothing may be planned on top of it. PAID ⇒ settle. A `spending` row bound to a quote ⇒
///    otherwise HOLD, whatever the mint says and however old the quote (addendum 6 §1.2). A
///    `planned` row: FAILED / expired ⇒ release; UNPAID / no quote ⇒ release only if the row is
///    this process's own or its owner's lease has run out, else refuse; PENDING ⇒ refuse this run
///    ([`reconcile_decision`]).
/// 2. Read the unremitted total. Zero ⇒ refuse (nothing to do), before any network.
/// 3. Resolve the destination; refuse below its minimum with the shortfall (expected for small
///    sellers, not an error).
/// 4. Probe the melt fee reserve on an invoice for the GROSS, then invoice for `gross − reserve` so
///    the fee comes out of the accrued amount — a seller never pays more than it accrued — and check
///    the second quote still fits.
/// 5. Print the plan. A dry run stops here.
/// 6. Journal the plan (pins the receipts, records this process as owner under [`REMIT_LEASE`];
///    refuses a duplicate). Then, in this order (addendum 5 §1 rule 1): raise the PAYMENT quote
///    and check the ceiling against its amount and reserve — refused ⇒ release the row (still
///    planned, ours, nothing spent) and journal failed; pass the fence — one compare-and-set that
///    marks the row spending and BINDS that quote, with the clock read inside the store call and
///    more than [`SPEND_MARGIN`] of lease left; pay that quote BY ID, re-checking the ceiling
///    immediately before `prepare_melt`; settle. A payment ERROR after the fence leaves the row
///    `spending`, bound to its quote, for step 1 of the next run — which asks the mint about THAT
///    quote, never raises another for the row, settles on PAID and otherwise holds.

    // store, two owners, two connections, one shared fake mint and one shared fake wallet:
    //   A plans X at 100, its fence admits X and binds Q (Q expires at 200; X's invoice is still
    //   valid), A passes its own pre-await margin check (200 > 100 + 60), the wallet's ceiling and
    //   proof selection (exact denominations 8+4+2+1 out of two disjoint such sets) and
    //   `prepare_melt`'s expiry check on the wallet's clock — and PAUSES there, its request built
    //   but not yet at the mint.
    //   The shared clock moves to 261: Q is past expiry and past the old margin.
    //   B — another owner, disjoint proofs left in the same wallet — is refused at TWO named
    //   boundaries, exercised separately (addendum 7 §1; verdict at 6fd13df §5 D1):
    //     (i) RECONCILIATION: B runs `--dry-run` then `--confirm` through the real `remit`. Step 1
    //         of `remit_inner` finds X in flight, asks the mint about Q BY ID, gets UNPAID (expired),
    //         and `reconcile_decision` HOLDS — `Refusal::SpendingHeld`, returned before any plan.
    //         While X is bound and spending, EVERY `remit` on this store stops here by design; it
    //         never reaches `plan_remittance`, so these two runs do not exercise the store's own
    //         predicate — the next boundary does.
    //     (ii) STORE: between those two runs B makes a concrete planning attempt for a distinct
    //         invoice Y, on B's own connection, through the store's admission entry
    //         `plan_remittance` — the call `remit_inner` step 6 makes. Its in-flight predicate
    //         (`in_flight_remittance_in`, inside the `IMMEDIATE` transaction) refuses with
    //         `PlanRefused::InFlight` naming X: no Y row, receipts still pinned to X, no quote
    //         raised, no debit. This is the race-closing layer the ordinary held-row path never
    //         reaches while X is spending; it is reached here directly, not by hand-written SQL.
    //   At both boundaries 15 sats of exact proofs are still in the wallet, so neither refusal is
    //   for want of funds.
    //   A resumes: the mint (as the inspected CDK 0.17.2 implementation does) accepts the expired
    //   UNPAID Q and pays X.
    // Exactly ONE debit, never two — and it is one because B was never admitted while X was bound
    // and spending, NOT because Q expired: at 6fc77e1 the same ordering released X on the expired
