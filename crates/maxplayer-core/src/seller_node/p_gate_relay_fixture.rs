//! An in-process relay that reproduces maxplayer-relay's `#p`-gate wire behaviour, and records what the
//! client actually sent.
//!
//! The `nostr-relay-builder` fixture used elsewhere in this crate cannot express the failure in #189.
//! Its NIP-42 read gate answers an unauthenticated `REQ` with the `auth-required:` prefix
//! (`local/inner.rs:961-989`), which nostr-sdk classifies as `MarkAsClosed` — the subscription stays
//! in the registry and the post-auth `resubscribe()` restores it automatically. The bug under test is
//! precisely what happens when the relay says `restricted:` instead: nostr-sdk classifies that as
//! `Remove` (`relay/inner.rs:1028`), deletes the subscription, and nothing ever restores it. A
//! fixture that self-heals would report every ordering as green.
//!
//! So this speaks the deployed relay's rule directly: a `REQ` carrying a `#p` filter is refused with
//! `restricted:` unless the session has completed NIP-42 **and** the `#p` value is the authenticated
//! pubkey. That one rule covers both cases the teeth need to tell apart — the pre-auth race (right
//! `#p`, no auth yet) and a genuine gate violation (someone else's `#p`, fully authed).
//!
//! Every `REQ` is recorded with the session's auth state at the moment it arrived, which is the
//! property #189 is actually about: a REQ that reaches the relay before AUTH does.
