//! The outbox publisher: drain the durable event outbox to the relay, retrying until each event is
//! confirmed or expires.
//!
//! The store is the source of truth: a state change and the event it must publish are written in one
//! transaction ([`super::store`]). This publisher is the async half — it reads `pending` rows, hands
//! each to an [`EventPublisher`], and records the outcome. Because every enqueue is deduped on a
//! stable key and every event is signed at a fixed authored-at second, a re-publish after a crash is
//! idempotent at the relay: the same event id is sent again and the relay collapses it. That is what
//! lets the publisher retry freely without ever double-paying or double-delivering.
//!
//! The concrete relay transport (sign via the signer actor, send over a nostr client) is the
//! deployable [`EventPublisher`] the node wires at cutover; this module owns the durable-drain logic
//! and is exercised here against a fake publisher so the retry/confirm/expire behavior is pinned
//! independent of the network.
