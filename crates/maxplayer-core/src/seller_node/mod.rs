//! The persistent per-home **maxplayer seller node**.
//!
//! One node owns a home. It takes an exclusive OS lock on `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/seller.lock` (a second node
//! on the same home fails closed), opens the receiving CDK wallet and the seller Nostr identity
//! behind serialized in-process actors, and opens the durable lifecycle DB `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/seller.sqlite`
//! — the source of truth for offers, claims, awards, jobs, deliveries, receipts, and the nostr event
//! outbox. A single relay ingester ([`ingester`]) writes marketplace events into the store; an async
//! publisher ([`outbox`]) drains published events to the relay with crash-idempotent retries; a
//! deterministic roster ([`roster`]) routes each awarded job to one agent under the single seller
//! identity.
//!
//! Concurrency safety does not depend on running one job at a time: the queue behind each actor —
//! not SQLite locking — is the in-process concurrency boundary, mirroring the home lock across
//! processes. Even with several execution slots active (`[seller] slots`), no two operations ever
//! race the wallet, the signer, or the store — the actors serialize them regardless of how many
//! jobs run at once.
//!
//! Money-safe boundary: agents produce files; the node signs, commits, publishes, and receives
//! payment. No agent process ever holds the seller key (owned by the [`signer`] actor) or the
//! receiving wallet (owned by the [`wallet_actor`]). This mirrors the buyer daemon's shape; a shared
//! node core is deferred until both consumers exist (issue #131).
