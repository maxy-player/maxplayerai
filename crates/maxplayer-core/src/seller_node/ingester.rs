//! The single relay ingester: one stream of marketplace events in, durable rows out.
//!
//! Exactly one ingester writes to the DB. It pulls parsed marketplace events from an
//! [`EventStream`] — offers to consider, awards selecting a claim — and lands each in the store
//! idempotently ([`super::store`]). Nothing else mutates the offer/award tables, so there is a
//! single writer and a single ordering; execution and payment read this state, they never race the
//! relay.
//!
//! The stream is abstracted so the pipeline (source → store) is pinned by tests against an
//! in-memory source. The concrete nostr subscription that decodes relay events into
//! [`IngestEvent`]s is the deployable [`EventStream`] the node wires at cutover.
