//! The seller node's durable lifecycle state: `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/seller.sqlite`.
//!
//! Opened only by the node (single-owner, guaranteed by the home lock). This SQLite database — in
//! WAL mode, `synchronous=FULL`, foreign keys on — is the **source of truth** for the seller's
//! trade lifecycle: the offers it has seen, the claims it has parked, the awards it has been
//! selected for, the jobs it is running, its deliveries and its collected receipts. Alongside them
//! sits the **nostr event outbox**: every event the node publishes is written to the DB and
//! enqueued in the SAME transaction as the state change that produced it, then handed to an async
//! publisher that retries until the relay confirms it or it expires. A crash between "state
//! changed" and "event sent" therefore never loses the obligation to publish, and never publishes
//! twice — the outbox `dedup_key` makes re-enqueue a no-op and the stored `created_at` makes the
//! signed event's id deterministic, so a re-publish is relay-idempotent.
//!
//! Every transition here is idempotent: replaying an award, a delivery, or a receipt lands the same
//! state and never double-credits. `rusqlite`'s [`Connection`] is `Send` but not `Sync`, so the
//! store keeps it behind a mutex and callers reach it from the async runtime via `spawn_blocking`.

/// Current on-disk schema version. v8 added `receipts.fee_bps` / `receipts.fee_sats` (the platform
/// fee, stage 1 — journaled, not remitted). v9 added `receipts.mint_fee_sats` (the mint's own swap
/// fee, so a receipt shows every figure between what the buyer paid and what the seller keeps).
/// v10 (stage 2a) added the `fee_remittances` table and `receipts.remittance_id` — which
/// remittance, if any, discharged each receipt's platform fee — so the unremitted balance is a
/// query and a paid fee can never be paid twice; and `fee_remit_attempts`, the journal of every
/// attempt to pay (automatic or by command) with its outcome, so a failing payout is visible.
/// v11 (stage 2a, addendum 3) added four nullable columns to `fee_remittances`: `owner` and
/// `lease_until_unix` — the durable ownership of a `planned` row, so reconciliation in another
/// process can never release a live payer's intent — and `melt_fee_reserve_sats` / `settled_by`,
/// so a settlement records the reserve of the quote that paid and how the row was settled (by the

/// compare-and-set immediately before the melt, it marks the planned row SPENDING — admitted to the
/// irreversible spend — and a spending row is never released on lease expiry, only on a quote the
/// mint reports terminal.
