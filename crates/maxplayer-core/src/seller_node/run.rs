    // previously skipped offer is claimed WITHOUT a restart. The re-delivered lapsed offer must NOT
    // be re-claimed — its `released` claim row dedups it — the money-safety property the fix leans on.
    //
    // The slot is freed by a claim LAPSE (`claim_award_timeout_secs = 0` ⇒ the next sweep reclaims
    // it), needing no award/execute cycle, so the whole drive is deterministic with no wall-clock
    // waits. Freeing via a losing award (which would also exercise #456's loser-release) needs a
