//! Shared in-process libgit2 transport for every maxplayer relay-git leg — seller push, seller
//! base-fetch, buyer verify-fetch, and ref-advertisement probes (ls-remote / boot preflight).
//!
//! No system `git` is used on any product path. A rustls-backed smart-HTTP
//! subtransport is registered for the `https` scheme; it injects a NIP-98 `Authorization`
//! header on every request so write/read auth rides the wire regardless of the local git
//! version (git ≤ 2.53 drops the header on the streamed POST retry). TLS is reqwest/rustls;
//! `git2` is built `default-features = false` so libgit2 never links openssl or its own HTTP.
//!
//! ## Security properties (these replace the system-git scrub machinery, and are stronger)
//! - **Transport allowlist / `ext::` RCE:** every entry point calls
//!   [`assert_allowed_repo_locator`] first, and only `https` is registered — `ext:`/`file:`/`ssh:`
//!   locators are refused before any remote is constructed. Belt-and-suspenders: the helpers
//!   re-assert the allowlist internally.
//! - **`insteadOf` / ambient-config immunity:** at first use, [`ensure_registered`] empties
//!   libgit2's global/XDG/system config search path, so NO ambient git config is consulted on any
//!   in-process leg. This is load-bearing: libgit2 applies `url.*.insteadOf` at CONNECT time and
//!   [`Repository::remote_anonymous`] does NOT prevent it — only clearing the search path does. So an
//!   ambient or agent-planted/poisoned `$HOME`/XDG/system config can never rewrite an allowlisted
//!   `https` URL onto another host or a banned transport after the allowlist check (#610). Only a
//!   repo-LOCAL config (in a workdir we create) is ever read, and none rewrites.
//! - **Key hygiene:** the seller/buyer secret is used ONLY in-process to sign the NIP-98 event.
//!   It is never placed on argv, never in child env, and never spawns a subprocess.
