//! Shared in-process libgit2 transport for every maxplayer relay-git leg — seller push, seller
//! base-fetch, buyer verify-fetch, and ref-advertisement probes (ls-remote / boot preflight).
//!
//! No system `git` is used on any product path. A rustls-backed smart-HTTP
//! subtransport is registered for the `https` scheme; it injects a NIP-98 `Authorization`
//! header on every request so write/read auth rides the wire regardless of the local git
//! version (git ≤ 2.53 drops the header on the streamed POST retry). TLS is reqwest/rustls;
//! `git2` is built `default-features = false` so libgit2 never links openssl or its own HTTP.
//!
//! ## Security properties (these replace the system-git scrub machinery, and are stronger)
//! - **Transport allowlist / `ext::` RCE:** every entry point calls
//!   [`assert_allowed_repo_locator`] first, and only `https` is registered — `ext:`/`file:`/`ssh:`
//!   locators are refused before any remote is constructed. Belt-and-suspenders: the helpers
//!   re-assert the allowlist internally.
//! - **Ambient-config immunity:** at first use, [`ensure_registered`] empties libgit2's
//!   global/XDG/system config search path, so NO ambient git config is consulted on any in-process
//!   leg. libgit2 applies `url.*.insteadOf` from the repository's config when it creates a remote,
//!   and [`Repository::remote_anonymous`] does NOT prevent it — only clearing the search path does.
//!   So an ambient or poisoned `$HOME`/XDG/system config can never rewrite an allowlisted `https`
//!   URL after the allowlist check (#610). Only a repo-LOCAL config is ever read.
//! - **Destination binding (repo-local config, any source):** the repo-local config of a job
//!   workdir is job-written, and libgit2 can also reach a config through `.git/commondir`. So every
//!   leg is bound to the URL the caller named, independent of repository configuration:
//!   [`bound_remote`] refuses a remote whose resolved `url()`/`pushurl()` differs from the caller's
//!   URL (libgit2 stores the `insteadOf` result there at creation, before any connection), and
//!   [`NostrHttp::action`] compares the URL libgit2 hands over for each https leg against the same
//!   intended URL ([`same_destination`]) and builds NO request on a mismatch. The header can only
//!   ever travel to the intended destination. The push side additionally opens the workdir through
//!   the layout gate ([`crate::seller_git::open_plain_workdir_repo`]).
//! - **Object-sourced push, answered by the remote's own ACK (C6):** [`push_branch_with_header`]
//!   pushes the gated commit OBJECT (`<oid>:refs/heads/<branch>`), never a local ref name a
//!   surviving job process could move under the push, and requires the remote's status report to
//!   name exactly that ref with no error. That per-ref ACK is the whole answer: silence, a report
//!   for another ref, or a rejection all fail. No advertisement is re-read after the push. It never
//!   re-resolves the local branch.
//! - **Authorization minted per WIRE REQUEST:** an operation carries an [`AuthMinter`], not a
//!   finished header. [`HttpStream::send`] calls it immediately before each request is put on the
//!   wire, handing it the repo-root URL that request is about to reach — so the advertisement leg,
//!   the pack POST and any later attempt each present their own token, signed after whatever lock
//!   or wait preceded them, and a minter can refuse a destination it did not authorize. No token
//!   lifetime is extended to cover the gap. Automatic redirects are DISABLED on both clients
//!   ([`client_default`], [`client_short`]): a redirect is a destination the minter never saw and
//!   the binding checks never ran on, so a 3xx fails the leg instead of silently forwarding the
//!   token (and, on a 307/308, the pack) to wherever it points.
//! - **Key hygiene:** the seller/buyer secret is used ONLY in-process to sign the NIP-98 event.
//!   It is never placed on argv, never in child env, and never spawns a subprocess.
//!
//! A leaked branch-scoped token is bounded authority, not zero authority: it can replay a push to
//! that one ref of that one repository until it expires. The binding above keeps it from leaving.
