//! Seller-side platform fee, stage 1: a product-set rate, computed and journaled when a payment is
//! collected.
//!
//! Two pieces live here — the rate ([`PLATFORM_FEE_BPS`]) and the arithmetic ([`fee_sats`]) — so the
//! collect seam reads one and calls the other instead of reimplementing either. Ungated on purpose:
//! the arithmetic is worth compiling and testing on every build, not only the money-path one.
//!
//! ## What this stage does and does not do
//!
//! The fee is **accrued and recorded**. Every collected payment journals the rate in force and the
//! sats it comes to, against the job that earned it. **Nothing is remitted**: there is no fee
//! recipient in the product yet, so no call here or in any caller moves a sat. Paying the accrued
//! balance out is a later stage that sits on top of this journal.
//!
//! ## Who sets the rate
//!
//! The product does, in this source file. A seller cannot change it: there is no config key, no env
//! override and no CLI flag, and nothing parses, so nothing can fail at load.

/// The platform fee rate, in **basis points** (`1 bp = 0.01%`, so `250` is 2.5% and `10_000` is the
/// whole payment). This constant is the whole specification of the fee:
///
/// - It is set by the product, here, and not by the seller. No config surface reads or writes it.
/// - It is applied to the offer's **face** amount — the price the buyer paid, which is what the
///   receipt journals as `amount_sats` — not to the smaller sum that lands in the seller's wallet
///   after the mint takes its own swap fee.
/// - The fee on a payment is `floor(face × PLATFORM_FEE_BPS / 10_000)`; it **rounds down**, so a
///   payment too small to earn a whole sat at this rate owes a fee of zero.
/// - The rate in force is journaled beside every receipt (`receipts.fee_bps`), so a store that
///   outlives a change to this number still says what each collection owed.
///
/// **Currently `1000` — ten percent.** Stage 1 accrues and records what this rate comes to on each
/// collection; it pays nobody, because no payout destination exists in the product yet. The rows
/// this stage writes are a journal, not a bill.

/// earn, and a payment too small to owe a whole sat owes zero — a fee, not an error.
