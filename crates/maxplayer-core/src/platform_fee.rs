//! Seller-side platform fee: a product-set rate, computed and journaled when a payment is collected
//! (stage 1), and a product-set payout destination the accrued balance is remitted to — automatically,
//! by the seller node, as a consequence of collecting (stage 2a).
//!
//! Three pieces live here — the rate ([`PLATFORM_FEE_BPS`]), the arithmetic ([`fee_sats`]) and the
//! destination ([`PLATFORM_FEE_ADDRESS`]) — so the collect seam and the remit path read them instead
//! of reimplementing any. Ungated on purpose: the arithmetic is worth compiling and testing on every
//! build, not only the money-path one.
//!
//! ## What is accrued, and what pays it
//!
//! The fee is **accrued and recorded** at collect time: every collected payment journals the rate in
//! force and the sats it comes to, against the job that earned it. **The seller node then remits it
//! automatically**: once the receipt is journaled new, the node makes a best-effort attempt to pay
//! the whole unremitted balance to [`PLATFORM_FEE_ADDRESS`] from the seller's ecash (`fee_remit`,
//! reached from `seller_node::run`). That attempt cannot affect the collect — the job is already
//! paid — and a failed attempt leaves the balance unremitted for the next collect to try again;
//! balances below the destination's minimum accrue until they clear it. `maxplayer seller fees
//! remit` is the operator's inspection and recovery path (dry run by default, `--confirm` to pay
//! now), not the mechanism. The one operational switch, `[platform_fee] auto_remit`, stops the
//! automatic attempt and nothing else: it cannot touch the rate or the destination, and the fee stays
//! owed and visible.
//!
//! ## Who sets the rate and the destination
//!
//! The product does, in this source file. A seller cannot change either: there is no config key, no
//! env override and no CLI flag, and nothing parses, so nothing can fail at load. See
//! [`PLATFORM_FEE_ADDRESS`] for why the destination in particular must not be seller-editable.

/// The platform fee rate, in **basis points** (`1 bp = 0.01%`, so `250` is 2.5% and `10_000` is the
/// whole payment). This constant is the whole specification of the fee:
///
/// - It is set by the product, here, and not by the seller. No config surface reads or writes it.
/// - It is applied to the offer's **face** amount — the price the buyer paid, which is what the
///   receipt journals as `amount_sats` — not to the smaller sum that lands in the seller's wallet
///   after the mint takes its own swap fee.
/// - The fee on a payment is `floor(face × PLATFORM_FEE_BPS / 10_000)`; it **rounds down**, so a
///   payment too small to earn a whole sat at this rate owes a fee of zero.
/// - The rate in force is journaled beside every receipt (`receipts.fee_bps`), so a store that
///   outlives a change to this number still says what each collection owed.
///
/// **Currently `1000` — ten percent.** Collection accrues and records what this rate comes to on
/// each payment, and the seller node then remits the accrued balance to [`PLATFORM_FEE_ADDRESS`]
/// automatically, best-effort, after the receipt is journaled (`fee_remit`); `maxplayer seller fees
/// remit --confirm` pays it by hand. The receipt rows are the journal every remittance settles
/// against. Nothing about this rate is read from config or environment.

///
/// - It is set by the product, here, and **not by the seller**. There is no config key, no env
///   override and no CLI flag, deliberately: the seller runs this binary, and the seller is the
///   party that owes the fee. A seller-editable `fee_address` would let any seller point the
///   platform's fee at themselves. A compiled-in constant costs a release to change; a seller-editable
///   one costs the whole fee. The release is the cheaper defect.
/// - It is resolved at remit time over LNURL-pay (`https://host/.well-known/lnurlp/user`), fail
///   closed, by [`crate::lnurl_pay`] — by the seller node's automatic attempt after a collect and by
///   `maxplayer seller fees remit`, and by nothing else. Nothing in this module contacts it.
/// - The `[platform_fee] auto_remit` switch cannot change it: that table has no key for an address.
/// - **Every remittance journals the literal it paid** (`fee_remittances.destination`), so a later
///   change to this constant leaves a readable history rather than an ambiguous one.
