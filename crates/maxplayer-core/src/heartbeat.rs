//! Seat announcement — addressable kind-30340 capability + liveness (protocol-v1 §4.2).
//!
//! A running seller republishes an **addressable** (NIP-01 parameterized-replaceable) event,
//! `d="maxplayer-seller"`, on a ~5-minute cadence. It carries every seat-level fact a buyer needs
//! before it trades: whether the seat is `accepting` new work, its `queue_depth`, its `rate`, the
//! `accepted_mints` it can be paid on, and the `agents` it can run. Every fact is current as of that
//! beat EXCEPT two: [`HARNESS_MODEL_TAG`] is last-observed and [`CAPABILITIES_TAG`] is bounded by
//! the seat's uptime. `docs/protocol-v1.md` §4.5.4 is normative for both.
//!
//! **This is the seat's only capability surface.** Issue #645 retired the kind-31990 handler
//! announce that used to carry the mints and the harness label; a reader must take capability from
//! here and nowhere else. Old 31990 events persist on relays as residue (replaceable events are
//! never deleted) — they are not live capability.
//!
//! None of this feeds the pay gate, journal, or receipt bind: it is pre-trade discovery. The
//! payable mint for one trade is the one carried by that trade's `creq`.
//!
//! **Resolve by `(pubkey, d)`, never by event id.** An addressable event is superseded in place,
//! so a superseded id goes empty and a by-id lookup would read as "seller gone." Consumers must
//! always resolve the latest heartbeat by author + `d`. See [`HeartbeatKey`].
//!
//! **A seat that leaves the role publishes one last beat saying so** — [`retraction_for_state`],
//! issue #747. Because the kind is addressable, whatever a seat published last is its permanent
//! public answer: a seat that simply stops beating leaves `accepting=y` standing forever, and no
//! amount of waiting produces a newer event to correct it. The retraction is not a new event type;
//! it is this same publisher told `accepting=false`, which is the only thing that can overwrite that
//! answer at the same address.
//!
//! ⛔ That terminal beat is INSURANCE, NOT REPAIR, and it must never be described as making the
//! directory truthful. Only a process that is still running can publish it, so it covers a graceful
//! exit and nothing else — SIGKILL, a panic that skips unwinding, an OOM kill and a power cut all
//! leave the last `accepting=y` exactly where it was. Consumer-side recency filtering (protocol-v1
//! §4.4: a recent announcement proves only that the seat published) stays the only cover for those,
//! and stays required with this in place. Belt AND braces.

/// commitment rather than an observation.
///
/// The value is whatever that harness's own ACP `session/new` reports as its resolved session model,
/// verbatim — never operator-typed. TWO wire shapes carry it and the driver reads both: legacy
/// `models.currentModelId`, or the first model-category Session Config Option's `currentValue` for
/// adapters that publish it there instead (see `driver::acp_driver::session_model_from_result`).
///
/// The SAME MODEL-ID NAMESPACE later supplies the seller's `["model", name]` on the RESULT event
/// (`docs/protocol-v1.md` §6.4), which a buyer records as its own `model_used` attribution. Not one
/// FIELD — an adapter may advertise from one shape — but one namespace of ids, which is the property
/// that makes advertised and delivered directly COMPARABLE.
///
/// ⚠ One namespace is not one value: the two are separate reads and CAN differ honestly — see below.
///
/// ## The one thing this field must never be written as
///
/// ⚠ THE REFERENT IS NOT A TENSE. Every wording that upgrades this SELF-REPORT into an EXECUTION
/// FACT is the same defect, and it has been written in all three tenses already — "the model it
/// will use" (future), "the model it is serving" (present), "the model the job actually ran on"
/// (past). Rewriting one tense leaves the others, because the tense was never the error.
///
/// The test to apply to any new wording: ACP reports the resolved session model on the `session/new`
/// RESPONSE, before the harness does any work, and nothing in this codebase pins the model or reads
/// back what executed. Reading a second wire shape (#896) changed WHERE the value is found and
/// nothing about WHEN — it is still a pre-work self-report, so every wording rule below is untouched. So the field can carry only "what this harness said about itself, when it was
/// last asked". Anything stronger — ran, runs, will run, is serving, guarantees — is a claim no code
/// here supports.
///
/// What the value is worth is PROVENANCE: machine-sourced beats operator-typed, because an operator
/// can type a model the harness has never reported and nothing would notice. That is the argument
/// for reading it off the run rather than off config — never an argument that it binds execution.
///
/// ⚠ Comparable is not checked. Both ids are the seller's own report, and §6.4 states that nothing
/// verifies the execution-metadata block and that a reader MUST NOT treat it as proof a given model
/// ran. A divergence is an inconsistency a buyer can see in its own records — never a falsifier.
///
/// ## Why paired, and why not a flat list
///
/// A model belongs to a harness; it is not an independent axis. On a multi-harness seat a bare model
/// does not say which harness would run, so the ADVERTISEMENT pairs each model to the family that
/// carries it — a flat list could not say which is which.
///
/// ⚠ Pairing the advertisement is not the same as binding execution, and the two must not be run
/// together. What dispatch selects on is the PRESET
/// ([`crate::seller_agents::AgentRegistry::dispatch`] is exact-or-nothing on the preset NAME, and
/// falls back to the seat's first preset when none is named). A family is not read there at all. So
/// a model request inherits no guarantee from a family request; it is the `agent` preset that a
/// model must be paired with on the REQUEST side, and only that pairing reaches execution.
///
/// The flat `["models", id, …]` this replaces cannot express that pairing. Pairing by POSITION
/// against the family list was rejected for a sharper reason: a harness that reports no model
/// contributes no entry, which desyncs every index after it SILENTLY — the tag still parses and the
/// filter matches a model attributed to the wrong harness. A single composite token was rejected too,
/// because model ids are not separator-safe (`org/model:tag` exists), which would put a parse that
/// can fail inside the award decision. This 3-element form has no separator, no index coupling, and
/// an absent model simply means an absent tag with nothing else shifting. It is also the grammar this
/// codebase already uses for keyed values (`["param", "agent", "claude"]`).
///
/// ## One namespace is not one value
///
/// The advertisement and the RESULT are two SEPARATE `session/new` invocations, minutes apart, and
/// `reasoning_effort` — which composes into the bracket suffix of the very id being filtered on — is
/// a settable harness control. So an advertised id CAN differ from the delivered one with no liar
/// involved: two honest reads at two times. This design does not eliminate that drift; it reduces it
/// to the rate #784's advertised-versus-delivered detector was built to catch. Advertising the
/// harness's full `availableModels` instead would have made that detector fire on nearly every job,
/// and a detector that always fires is not a detector. Issue #785 carries the model-selection work
/// that would close the gap properly.

/// prove-before-advertise discipline the harness roster already follows. There is deliberately no
/// config key for it, because enum-binding would not make a configured value TRUE.
///
/// ENUM-BINDING SOLVES CANONICALISATION, NOT TRUTH. It guarantees `rust` and `Rust` become one
/// spelling; it says nothing about whether the seat can build Rust. A filterable field needs
/// provenance, not just a tidy spelling — a buyer commits sats at award, and an operator-typed
/// capability has nothing that could contradict it.
///
/// The concrete case is measured, not hypothetical: the shipped Docker runtime stage installs
/// `ca-certificates` and `tini` and copies one binary, so a seat on the stock image has no cargo, no
/// node and no python — every token in the vocabulary would be false there if declared (#358).
/// Probed, that same seat honestly advertises none, and #358 stops being reachable by construction.
///
/// ⚠ THE PROBE RUNS WHERE JOBS RUN, NEVER ON THE SEAT HOST. The execution environment is
/// operator-built, so only the seat can answer. A host-side `which` is the right predicate in the
/// wrong environment: it would prove a capability the JOB will not have, which is #358's own shape
/// one level down.
///
/// ## What filtering a token GUARANTEES, and what it does not
///
/// Filtering `rust` guarantees "`cargo` resolved on PATH in the JOB environment AT PROBE TIME". It
/// does NOT guarantee a build succeeds. Presence is necessary, not sufficient. The gap is honest and
/// unavoidable — but a buyer commits sats on the token, so the contract is written here rather than
/// left to a reader's inference. The probe command IS the token's definition: `rust` ⇒ `cargo`,
/// `node` ⇒ `node`, `python` ⇒ `python3`. A new token ships WITH its probe command.
///
/// ## Known asymmetry — probing buys provenance, not detectability
///
/// No filterable field has dispatch enforcement, and this one also has no echo a buyer could
/// compare against. `harness_family` is NOT enforced by dispatch: dispatch selects on the offer's
/// `agent` preset alone and runs the seat's first preset when none is named, so a family decides who
/// may be CONSIDERED and never what executes. `harness_model` is merely ECHOED: the result carries
/// `["model", name]`, so a buyer can notice a divergence from what it awarded on, but both values
/// are the SELLER'S OWN WORD and `docs/protocol-v1.md` §6.4 states that nothing verifies that block.
/// It is an inconsistency signal, not a falsifier. No event carries a capability back at all.
///
/// The residual is accepted because the probe makes the claim true at the SOURCE, and because
/// presence is honestly necessary-not-sufficient for any capability signal — but the three are one
/// echo and two silences, and must not be read as grades of the same proof.
///
/// ## Freshness — bounded by UPTIME, not by the beat
///
/// The probe runs ONCE, at seat start, and every beat for the life of the process republishes that
/// same snapshot. So the staleness bound is how long the seat has been running, and a recent beat is
/// no evidence of a recent measurement.
///
/// TWO fields narrow §4.2's general rule, not one: this one is uptime-bounded and
/// [`HARNESS_MODEL_TAG`] is last-observed. [`HARNESS_FAMILY_TAG`] is the only filterable field that
/// is genuinely current as of the beat carrying it. See `docs/protocol-v1.md` §4.5.4, normative.

/// seat's environment is not advertised until restart — the seat under-claims and loses awards it
/// could have won. A toolchain REMOVED from a running seat keeps being advertised until restart, so
