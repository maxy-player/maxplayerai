//! Flexible ecash wallet ops for `maxplayer wallet` / MCP mirrors, over the packaged CDK wallet at
//! `home/.maxplayer/wallet`. This module owns the mint-fund path: [`begin_mint_async`] creates a mint
//! quote and returns the bolt11 invoice up front, then [`complete_mint_async`] mints once it is
//! paid. ([`crate::buyer_fund`] covers wallet open, seed derivation, and balance read.)
//!
//! **Funding assumption:** only the pinned testnut host ([`DEFAULT_MINT_URL`])
//! FakeWallet-auto-pays mint quotes. For other configured mints, [`begin_mint_async`]
//! returns the bolt11 and callers must pay it, then [`complete_mint_async`].
