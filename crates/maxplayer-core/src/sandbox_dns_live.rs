//! Live DNS runtime gate: the verdict's "Minimal future Linux gate", executed against a real kernel.
//!
//! Everything else that tests [`crate::sandbox_dns`] asserts what is *rendered*. That is exactly the
//! gap the focused verdict left open: F1/F2/F3 are closed for the source contract, and nothing in the
//! repository has ever asked a running kernel whether a contained job can actually resolve a name
//! through the resolver file the launch wrote for it. A rendered `--dport 53 -j ACCEPT` and an
//! enforced one produce the same green.
//!
//! These tests are `#[ignore]`d: they need a docker daemon, the first-party netfilter image, and two
//! throwaway fixture images. They are HARNESS ONLY — they add no product behaviour and change none.
//! Run them inside an owned, isolated VM:
//!
//! ```text
//! docker build -t mxdns-resolver:local  <dnsmasq image>
//! docker build -t mxdns-probe:local     <bind-tools/git/nc image>
//! cargo test -p maxplayer-core --features acp,wallet --lib sandbox_dns_live -- --ignored --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! **What each gate is for.** The product path under test is the real one, not a re-implementation:
//! [`crate::seller_exec::prepare_launch`] resolves the resolver set through
//! [`crate::sandbox_dns::resolve`], writes the job's `/etc/resolv.conf`, hands the SAME addresses to
//! [`crate::sandbox_netns::establish`], which installs the plan through the real sidecar and reads
//! both families back out of the kernel; the payload is then launched through
//! [`crate::seller_exec::SandboxPolicy::launch`], the same argv builder the daemon uses.
//!
//! **Controls.** Every denial is paired with a contemporaneous unfiltered probe of the same address
//! from outside the namespace. A destination that is merely unroutable, or a listener that died,
//! fails exactly like a dropped packet; only the control separates them.

/// **Gate G — FUNCTIONAL container Git delivery.** A contained job FETCHES a pinned base over

/// through the product's own container-delivery consumer — `maxplayer __deliver phase1`, launched
/// with the same `launch_with_mounts` argv builder, holder namespace and resolver file the seller
/// daemon uses (`seller_node::run::deliver_via_container`). No host git runs at any point in the
/// delivery: the host writes the inputs file, reads the oid file back, and asks the REMOTE what it
/// holds.
///
/// What each assertion is for:
/// - the endpoint is reached by NAME, so both git legs resolved through the resolver file the launch
///   wrote — the DNS contract and the delivery contract proven on one wire;
/// - the pushed commit's PARENT is the seeded base oid, which no local init could produce: the
///   clone/fetch leg really ran against the remote;
/// - the ref the remote advertises is the exact oid the orchestrator gated, read back from the
///   server side, not from the job's own repository;
/// - `KERNEL.txt` inside the pushed tree carries the delivery container's own gVisor banner.
///
/// FIXTURE ACCOMMODATIONS, named so they are not mistaken for product behaviour: the endpoint serves
/// a self-signed certificate, so the launch environment carries `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY` — the product
/// honours git's own variable (`git_transport.rs:130`) and nothing in the product is changed to
/// accept it; and the remote is anonymous `https`, so the push token source is
/// [`PushTokenSource::None`], the same arm the host takes for a non-relay remote. No credential, no
/// external repository and no relay is involved.
