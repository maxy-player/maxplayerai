//! Host-side credential-containment proxy (#647).
//!
//! A `[sandbox] mode = "docker"` job runs a stranger's code with unrestricted egress. Forwarding the
//! real model credential as `-e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…` fixed the *baked-into-the-image* leak, but the
//! job can still read that variable (`printenv`, `/proc/self/environ`) and exfiltrate a reusable
//! secret. This module removes the real credential from the container entirely.
//!
//! ## The mechanism (petar's DECIDED design, #647)
//!
//! One value carries two properties. Per job we mint a **format-plausible placeholder** in the
//! vendor's credential shape (`sk-ant-…`), forward *that* into the container in place of the real
//! key, and point the container's `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at this proxy. The proxy:
//!
//! 1. **identifies the job** by finding the placeholder value in a request header, and
//! 2. **substitutes** the real credential for the placeholder on the way out — **value-based across
//!    header values**, so it matches whichever header a vendor uses (`x-api-key`, `authorization`,
//!    `api-key`, …) without knowing the name. That header-agnosticism is what lets the same proxy
//!    serve `codex`, `cursor`, and any future harness with no per-vendor code.
//!
//! ## Why the BODY is never a substitution surface
//!
//! An earlier revision substituted the placeholder wherever it appeared, body included. That was a
//! **credential-recovery hole**, and closing it is why this module now touches headers only.
//!
//! Value-based matching over header VALUES already gives full header-agnosticism — the reason body
//! substitution was there in the first place. It bought no vendor coverage: every credential this
//! proxy contains travels in a header (`x-api-key` for the Anthropic API key, `Authorization: Bearer`
//! for the Anthropic auth/OAuth tokens and the OpenAI key). What it did buy was an injection surface,
//! because the body is the one part of the request a stranger's job writes freely:
//!
//! 1. The job reads its own placeholder (`/proc/1/environ` — the container env is readable to it).
//! 2. It posts to the proxy with the placeholder in the auth header AND inside a prompt string.
//! 3. The proxy substitutes BOTH, so the REAL credential lands in the prompt.
//! 4. The model repeats the prompt back, and the response reaches the container.
//!
//! The job now holds the real credential and containment is defeated. A variant needs no model
//! cooperation at all: put the placeholder in a field the API rejects and read the real value out of
//! the echoed error.
//!
//! The same reasoning already kept the URL path off the substitution surface; the body belongs in that
//! exclusion for identical reasons, and it is the larger surface of the two. The body is therefore
//! forwarded VERBATIM — it is not even an input to [`ProxyEngine::authorize`], so no future code path
//! can reintroduce the substitution. If some future harness genuinely carries a credential in the
//! body, it BREAKS here rather than leaking: the same fail-closed rule this module applies to derived
//! tokens.
//!
//! Defence in depth on the return leg: [`relay`] scrubs the real credential back to the placeholder in
//! the response headers and body. With the body no longer substituted, the only value that can echo is
//! the header the upstream itself reflects (a `401` quoting the key it rejected, say) — that scrub
//! catches it. It is the second line, never the first.
//!
//! What leaks from the container is now worthless: it only authenticates against *our* proxy, only
//! for the life of the job, and only for an allowlisted upstream.
//!
//! ## Non-negotiable invariants (babu, #647)
//!
//! - **Destination allowlist.** The real credential is substituted ONLY for an approved upstream. A
//!   request whose resolved destination is not on the allowlist is refused WITHOUT substitution —
//!   otherwise a job could point the placeholder at an attacker host and the proxy would hand over the
//!   real key, *worse* than today. See [`ProxyEngine::authorize`].
//! - **No fallback to the real credential.** If the override path cannot be satisfied (no known
//!   placeholder present, destination refused) the request fails; the caller NEVER falls back to
//!   putting the real credential in the container. A silent fallback is the one failure mode invisible
//!   from outside — jobs keep passing while containment is gone.
//! - **Substitute in header values ONLY — never the body, never the URL path.**
//!   [`ProxyEngine::authorize`] rewrites header values and nothing else; the request target and the
//!   body are forwarded verbatim. Both are attacker-authored, so neither may carry a real credential.
//! - **Format-plausible placeholder**, not a readable sentinel — see [`mint_anthropic_placeholder`].
//! - **No secret in any image.** The proxy is a host process; the container receives only the
//!   placeholder and the base-URL override.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! This module builds the proven **API-key path** (the spike confirmed the adapter honours
//! `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and the key rides a single `x-api-key` header verbatim). Substitution is
//! value-based rather than `x-api-key`-specific precisely so the OAuth path folds in later with no
//! change here — pending a separate verification that the OAuth token also travels verbatim.

/// allowlist never approved: the destination is decided BEFORE the redirect moves it.

/// That is measured, not inferred. `the_streamed_body_redirect_matrix_is_pinned_per_status` was first
/// written against a default client and recorded the real credential arriving at an unapproved host on
/// a cross-authority `301`. This construction is why that is not what ships, and it lives in this module
/// rather than at the call site because a safety property a caller can forget is not a safety property.
///
/// A redirect is followed only while it stays on the upstream the credential in flight was registered
/// for. That upstream is not the allowlist: [`ProxyEngine::authorize`] picks the destination from the
/// credential itself, and the allowlist is the UNION of every present credential's upstream. A union
/// check would approve a `3xx` from one registered vendor to ANOTHER — handing an Anthropic key to
/// OpenAI's host — because both are on it. A refused attempt is `stop()`, which returns the `3xx` for
/// the proxy to relay to the container unchanged.
///
/// `301`, `302` and `303` are the only statuses this policy ever judges. `307` and `308` preserve the
/// request body, and a relayed body is a stream that cannot be replayed, so `tower-http` surfaces those
/// two unchanged without consulting any policy — see
/// [`the_streamed_body_redirect_matrix_is_pinned_per_status`], which measures all five. The container
/// receives such a `3xx` verbatim and may act on it with its own placeholder-bearing client; what it
/// cannot do is have this proxy carry the real credential there.
///
/// The pairing is available without per-request state, which is why one client serves every request:
/// `Policy::custom` closes over nothing but the pure predicate, so no credential is reachable from
/// here — while the attempt carries its own chain, whose FIRST entry is the original request URL that
/// [`relay`] built from that credential's upstream.
///
/// EVERY HOP, not just the first, and each judged against the ORIGINAL rather than its predecessor:

    // the upstream connection deadlocks against that, which is the red-prove.
