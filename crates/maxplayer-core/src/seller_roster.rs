//! Which of a node's resolved harnesses are serving RIGHT NOW.
//!
//! [`crate::seller_agents::AgentRegistry`] answers what a node *resolved at boot*: a pure value,
//! fixed for the life of the process. This module answers the live question on top of it. A harness
//! that boots perfectly can still be unable to work — its account is at a spend limit, its provider
//! is unconfigured, the binary lacks the `acp` feature — and a node that keeps claiming for such a
//! harness is a black hole for awards: it takes work it cannot deliver, and under award-is-payment
//! the buyer has already committed the sats by the time we find out.
//!
//! [`LiveRoster`] owns the registry and the live availability state TOGETHER, and exposes the same
//! surface the node already reads (`advertised` / `dispatch` / `serves`). That is deliberate. The
//! registry's contract is *"advertised is exactly what dispatch serves"*; a separate health object
//! placed alongside it would leave the node free to read `advertised()` unfiltered and publish a
//! harness it would then refuse. Wrapping keeps the invariant true by construction instead of by
//! every caller remembering a second lookup.
//!
//! State is keyed by a harness's INDEX in the registry, not by its name, so the unlabelled
//! `--agent-argv` hatch is droppable like any other entry. A name-keyed map could not drop it at all
//! — the hatch has no name to key on — which would leave exactly one configuration permanently
//! unable to stop claiming: the black hole this module exists to close.
//!
//! "Index" and not "slot": in this node a SLOT is a unit of execution concurrency (`[seller] slots`,
//! and the permits `SlotGate` hands out). A harness's position in the registry is a different thing
//! entirely, and the two are independent — every execution slot can run any serving harness.
//!
//! ## Three states, because `CANNOT RUN` is not `FAILED`
//!
//! - **Serving** — advertised and dispatchable.
//! - **[`Unavailable::Dropped`]** — it failed in a way we cannot attribute. Transient (a timeout) and
//!   structural (a provider that will never resolve) arrive here IDENTICALLY, so this state does not
//!   guess: it stops claiming and schedules a self-probe to find out.
//! - **[`Unavailable::Incapable`]** — a NAMED missing capability. No probe is scheduled, because no
//!   number of retries adds a build feature or picks a provider. The state carries the capability and
//!   DERIVES the remedy from it ([`MissingCapability::remedy`]).
//!
//! Collapsing the last two is the defect this shape exists to prevent. A seat whose binary lacks
//! `acp` can never pass a probe, so a two-state design drops it on its first offer and never restores
//! it — silently converting a fixable *build* problem into a permanent roster hole, with no signal
//! saying which of the two it was.
//!
//! ## The backoff window gates the PROBE, never the restoration
//!
//! [`Unavailable::Dropped::probe_due_at`] is when a self-probe becomes DUE. It is not an expiry:
//! nothing returns to service when it passes, and [`LiveRoster::dispatch`] never auto-restores. Only
//! [`LiveRoster::restore`], called after a probe actually passed, puts a harness back.
//!
//! That distinction is load-bearing under award-is-payment. The sats for a job are committed at
//! AWARD, so a backoff that merely expired would make the next real offer our diagnostic and a
//! BUYER would pay for it. The probe is ours to run and ours to pay for.
