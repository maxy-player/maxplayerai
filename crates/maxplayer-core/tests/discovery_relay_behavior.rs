//! DISCOVERY, DRIVEN OVER A WIRE — the behavioral proof the unit tests cannot give.
//!
//! Advisor finding F3 against `aad7b2a`: the green gate did not exercise F1 at all. The
//! transport-shape tests compared CONSTRUCTORS and searched SOURCE STRINGS, the fixture started
//! from a hand-assembled unsigned draft rather than a signed announcement, and the target handoff
//! went through `OfferDraft`/`parse_offer` rather than the daemon's own post mapping. Every one of
//! those can pass while the relay leg is wrong, which is precisely what happened.
//!
//! So each test here drives the REAL [`discovery::fetch_directory_async`] against a scripted relay
//! and asserts on what came back:
//!
//! | Ending the relay scripts | What discovery must report |
//! |---|---|
//! | events + `EOSE` | rows, `read_confirmed = true` |
//! | no events + `EOSE` | empty, `read_confirmed = true` — an answered empty market |
//! | nothing at all, socket up | empty, `read_confirmed = FALSE` — an unanswered read |
//! | one event, then silence | that row KEPT, `read_confirmed = FALSE` |
//! | one event, then socket dropped | `read_confirmed = FALSE` |
//! | `CLOSED` naming our subscription | `Err(DiscoveryError::Relay)` carrying the reason |
//!
//! The announcements are SIGNED with a real key, built from a real `[seat]` config through the same
//! `Advertisement::capability` → `heartbeat_for_state` chain the seller daemon publishes through, so
//! a row here is evidence about the deployed path and not about a fixture. One test serves an event
//! whose signature has been tampered with and asserts it never becomes a row.
//!
//! No money anywhere: no wallet is opened, no mint is contacted, and the fixture records every
//! inbound frame so "discovery published nothing" is read off the wire rather than promised.
