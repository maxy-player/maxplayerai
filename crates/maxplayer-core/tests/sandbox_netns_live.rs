//! Live containment tests: these run real containers and ask a real kernel what it holds.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because they need a docker daemon and the two first-party images, so they are not
//! part of an ordinary `cargo test` run. Run them with:
//!
//! ```text
//! docker build -t mx-netfilter:live docker/maxplayer-netfilter
//! MAXPLAYER_NETFILTER_IMAGE=mx-netfilter:live \
//!   cargo test -p maxplayer-core --features acp,wallet --test sandbox_netns_live -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! **Why these exist at all.** Every other test in this crate asserts what is *rendered*. That is
//! exactly the gap a measured, total failure went through: the policy rendered correctly and could not
//! be applied, because a `--log-prefix` containing a space arrives at iptables as two arguments. Rule
//! 1 of 24 was refused, the namespace ended up with no rules, and 1069 unit tests stayed green. A test
//! that never executes a plan cannot see that class of bug.
//!
//! They are also the only red-prove of the readback. A verifier that always returns `Ok` would pass
//! every unit test written against a captured fixture, so each case here breaks containment in a
//! specific way against a live namespace and requires the refusal to name it.

// Gated on BOTH features, because this file needs `establish` (behind `acp`) and `SandboxPolicy`
// (behind `wallet`). Gating on `acp` alone breaks the acp-only CI row, which has no `wallet`.
//
// The row that runs it is "the full shipped feature combo (acp + wallet)" — added deliberately,
// because `acp` and `wallet` are never both on in any other `cargo test` here and a test gated on both
// would otherwise be compiled out everywhere. As ci.yml puts it: a compiled-out test and a passing
// test produce the same green. Verify membership with `cargo test … -- --list`, never by a green tick.
