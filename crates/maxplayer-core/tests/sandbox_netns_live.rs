//! Live containment tests: these run real containers and ask a real kernel what it holds.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because they need a docker daemon and the two first-party images, so they are not
//! part of an ordinary `cargo test` run. Run them with:
//!
//! ```text
//! docker build -t mx-netfilter:live docker/maxplayer-netfilter
//! MAXPLAYER_NETFILTER_IMAGE=mx-netfilter:live \
//!   cargo test -p maxplayer-core --features acp,wallet --test sandbox_netns_live -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! **Why these exist at all.** Every other test in this crate asserts what is *rendered*. That is
//! exactly the gap a measured, total failure went through: the policy rendered correctly and could not
//! be applied, because a `--log-prefix` containing a space arrives at iptables as two arguments. Rule
//! 1 of 24 was refused, the namespace ended up with no rules, and 1069 unit tests stayed green. A test
//! that never executes a plan cannot see that class of bug.
//!
//! They are also the only red-prove of the readback. A verifier that always returns `Ok` would pass
//! every unit test written against a captured fixture, so each case here breaks containment in a
//! specific way against a live namespace and requires the refusal to name it.

// Gated on BOTH features, because this file needs `establish` (behind `acp`) and `SandboxPolicy`
// (behind `wallet`). Gating on `acp` alone breaks the acp-only CI row, which has no `wallet`.
//
// The row that runs it is "the full shipped feature combo (acp + wallet)" — added deliberately,
// because `acp` and `wallet` are never both on in any other `cargo test` here and a test gated on both
// would otherwise be compiled out everywhere. As ci.yml puts it: a compiled-out test and a passing
// test produce the same green. Verify membership with `cargo test … -- --list`, never by a green tick.

// Everything above this line prepares a namespace by hand and then joins something to it. That
// proves these filters CAN be installed; it does not prove a real job is launched with them, and a
// gate that installs its own plan would stay green if `prepare_launch` stopped calling `establish`
// altogether.
//
// So this section goes through `seller_exec::with_prepared_launch`: the production `prepare_launch`
// establishes containment, the production `SandboxPolicy::launch` builds the argv, `netns` is wired
// from `holder_name` exactly as `run_agent_job_with_env` wires it, and the argv is executed
// verbatim. The separate OUTPUT-only reproduction above is kept deliberately — it is the baseline
// arm, and it must not be folded into this one.
//
// **The oracle.** A refusal and a launch that never happened are the same exit code, and reading
// docker's status alone lets a broken image, a missing mount or an OOM be scored as containment.
// Every payload here therefore prints a start marker before it tries anything and a result marker
// carrying the connection's own exit code, and the outcome is read from those markers. A payload
// that did not print the start marker is `NeverStarted` and is never counted as a denial.
