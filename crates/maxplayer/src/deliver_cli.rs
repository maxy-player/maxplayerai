//! `maxplayer __deliver phase1 <inputs.json>` — the container-side delivery orchestrator
//! (Track B). INTERNAL, not a user surface: the seller daemon runs this as the sandbox image
//! entrypoint so clone/gate/commit/push happen INSIDE the container, and the host never opens a git
//! repository the job agent could write.
//!
//! - `phase1`: the ONE-container delivery. Reads and DELETES the inputs file (C3), provisions the
//!   workdir, DRIVES the ACP agent itself (Task B9: no nested docker, an explicit environment
//!   allowlist), gates + sentinels + commits, reaps every other process, obtains the branch-scoped
//!   push token per the inputs' token source, pushes with the gated oid as the expected oid (C6), and
//!   writes the oid and an outcome file for the host. Exit 0 only when the push succeeded.
//!
//! The heavy lifting lives in [`maxplayer_core::delivery_orchestrator`]; this is only the argv shim.
//! `phase1` builds its own current-thread Tokio runtime inside the core entry, because this CLI is
//! synchronous.
