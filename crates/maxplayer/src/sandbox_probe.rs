//! `maxplayer sandbox-probe` — does the configured launcher actually contain anything?
//!
//! An open-pool seat executes code written by strangers. Whether it is contained is a property of
//! the launcher AT RUNTIME, and every cheaper question is next to it rather than it:
//!
//!   * `[sandbox]` being present says an operator wrote a config, not that it confines.
//!   * The launcher resolving on PATH says a file exists (#357). Bubblewrap INSTALLS cleanly on
//!     Ubuntu 24.04 and then fails at spawn — `setting up uid map: Permission denied`, the AppArmor
//!     unprivileged-userns restriction — so a resolve check PASSES a sandbox that confines nothing
//!     because it never runs (#451, measured on a live seat).
//!
//! So the gate runs the launcher and reads what it did. Two legs, because one proves nothing:
//!
//!   DENY  — a canary file outside the workdir must NOT be readable from inside.
//!   ALLOW — a file inside the job workdir must be writable.
//!
//! Deny alone passes a launcher that blocks everything, including the job. Allow alone passes a
//! launcher that blocks nothing. Only the pair describes containment.
//!
//! ── The split, and why the payload never judges ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! This module is both halves and they are deliberately different jobs. [`run`] is the PAYLOAD: it
//! runs INSIDE the launcher and only reports facts — whether the read worked, whether the write
//! worked. [`probe_containment`] is the GATE: it runs outside, establishes that the canary is
//! readable and the workdir writable WITHOUT the launcher first (without those controls a refusal
//! could be our own broken setup), then spawns the payload through the launcher and judges.
//!
//! A payload that decided its own verdict would be a program inside the sandbox reporting on the
//! sandbox.
