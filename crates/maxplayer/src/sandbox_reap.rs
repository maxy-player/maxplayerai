//! `maxplayer sandbox-reap --seat <hex>` — reap the containment holders a RETIRED seat left behind.
//!
//! The boot reaper (#876) removes only holders carrying the BOOTING seat's own key, because on a
//! host running several seller daemons ownership is the one thing that makes a removal safe. That
//! leaves a gap it cannot close by itself: a seat that never boots again never reaps, so its holders
//! survive forever (#905).
//!
//! ── Why this is an operator command and not automatic ────────────────────────────────────────────
//! The missing fact is not measurable on the host. "This seat is retired" and "this seat is slow to
//! start" produce identical evidence — a labelled holder with nothing attached — and no local query
//! separates them. The operator is the only party who holds that fact, so the operator supplies it,
//! by naming the seat. The seat id is therefore EVIDENCE, not a parameter:
//!
//!   * There is no default and no fallback to the local identity. A seat id nobody typed is a seat
//!     nobody vouched for, and the boot path already covers the local seat.
//!   * `--all` is REFUSED, with a message, rather than left unrecognised. See [`parse_options`].
//!   * Nothing here reads config or identity, so a boot has nothing to invoke it with. That is the
//!     "never at boot" constraint held structurally rather than by a comment.
//!
//! ── The asymmetry that sets the whole tone ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! A wrong reap kills a live job at launch and costs a real seat its award and a reputation record.
//! The leak it fixes costs one container and one namespace — disk, not money. The failure is far
//! more expensive than the bug, so every ambiguity here resolves toward refusing rather than
//! removing, and `--dry-run` exists so the expensive direction can be inspected before it is taken.
//!
//! ── One reap predicate, one place ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! This module adds NO selection logic. Both legs — ownership match AND idle namespace — stay in
//! `sandbox_netns::reapable_holders`, reached through `reapable_holders_live`; the removal stays in
//! `sandbox_netns::reap_orphans`. `--dry-run` calls the SAME selection and stops before removal, so
//! it is a second output, not a second predicate. A copy of the selection here is how the host-wide
//! predicate #876 removed would find its way back in.
