//! `maxplayer seller fees` — the seller-facing read-out of the platform fee journal — and
//! `maxplayer seller fees remit`, the operator's inspection and recovery path over the platform fee
//! remittance the seller node performs automatically after each collected payment.
//!
//! `seller fees` prints, per collected job and as a total, the four figures a seller needs to see
//! without doing arithmetic or reading source: what the buyer paid (the offer amount), the mint's
//! swap fee, the platform fee (rate and sats), and what the seller keeps — plus how much of the
//! platform fee has been remitted, how much is unremitted, and every remittance so far. Read-only as
//! to money: it opens `seller.sqlite` (applying the store's additive schema migration if the file
//! predates the current version), reads, prints, and exits.
//!
//! `seller fees remit` is the third of the three callers of `maxplayer_core::fee_remit::remit` (the
//! other two are the seller node's: its collect path, and the retry tick that backs a failed
//! remittance off and tries again while the node runs). It prints the recent remittance attempts and their
//! outcomes, reconciles an attempt interrupted mid-payment, resolves the platform's Lightning
//! address over LNURL-pay, takes a melt quote for the unremitted balance, and prints the plan.
//! **Without `--confirm` that is all it does** (a dry run is the default). With `--confirm` it forces
//! an attempt now — for an operator whose automatic path has been failing, or who has turned it off
//! with `[platform_fee] auto_remit = false` — paying the invoice from the seller's ecash through
//! `wallet_ops::pay_melt_quote_blocking`: the payment quote is raised first and checked against the
//! accrued gross, the store fence binds it to the row, and then exactly that quote is paid by id
//! (the same gated melt `maxplayer wallet melt` uses underneath — it honours `allow_real_mints` —
//! split into its quote step and its pay step), and recording the settlement so the same sats are
//! never paid twice. Running it again after a payment pays nothing.
