//! #828 — the seller's OPERATOR-AUTHORED context reaches the hired agent (read-on-start seam).
//!
//! `seller_memory` shipped whole and orphaned: the module, its `[seller_memory]` config and the
//! injection site inside `compose_agent_prompt` all existed, but `seller_node::run::job_prompt` —
//! "the ONE place a stored offer row becomes the hired agent's prompt" — passed a hardcoded `None`
//! for `memory_section`. So every job started blank no matter what an operator had written. That
//! single literal was the whole of the gap; this file is the tooth that keeps it closed.
//!
//! ── Why this tooth lives in an INTEGRATION TEST of the CLI crate ──────────────────────────────────
//!
//! Same reason as `seller_declared_output.rs`, and it is the reason `job_prompt` is `pub` at all
//! (`seller_node/run.rs`): the code under test is in `maxplayer-core`, but its `seller_node` module
//! is gated behind that crate's `wallet` feature, which is OFF by default. `cargo test -p
//! maxplayer-core --locked --offline` — a declared check — does not compile these tests, let alone
//! run them. The `maxplayer` crate has `default = ["wallet"]`, so `cargo test -p maxplayer --locked
//! --offline` builds this path and runs this file. A tooth for this seam that lived only in
//! `maxplayer-core` would be invisible to the declared check set.
//!
//! ── The bites, each applied ALONE and measured (this file, at this commit) ────────────────────────
//!   - restore the hardcoded `None` at `job_prompt`'s `compose_agent_prompt` call
//!     ⇒ `the_operator_authored_memory_index_reaches_the_agents_prompt` AND
//!       `the_golden_invariant_holds_no_memory_is_byte_identical` FAIL; the other three pass.
//!   - make `job_memory_section` ignore `memory_enabled`
//!     ⇒ `a_disabled_config_injects_nothing` FAILS alone.
//!   - make `job_memory_section` propagate the `InvalidData` error instead of degrading
//!     ⇒ `an_over_budget_index_degrades_instead_of_blocking_the_job` FAILS alone (it panics).
//!   - `None => format!("{base}\n\n")` in `compose_agent_prompt`'s `match memory_section`
//!     ⇒ `the_golden_invariant_holds_no_memory_is_byte_identical` FAILS alone.
//!
//! That last bite is why this file carries two assertions that do not route through `job_prompt(…,
//! None)`. The first version of the golden test derived its baseline that way and stayed GREEN under
//! the bite — a self-referential baseline moves with the arm it is meant to police. Measured, then
//! fixed, then re-measured red.
