//! #686 — the buyer's DECLARED OUTPUT TYPE reaches the hired agent.
//!
//! The offer's `["output", …]` tag is MANDATORY on ingest (`gateway::parse_offer` refuses an offer
//! without it) and is a MIME / output type — `text/plain`, `application/json`. It used to stop at the
//! parsed offer: it was never journaled with the other offer facts and never stated to the agent, so
//! the one party who has to act on it was the one party never told.
//!
//! ── Why this tooth lives in an INTEGRATION TEST of the CLI crate ──────────────────────────────────
//!
//! The code it exercises is in `maxplayer-core`, but that crate's `seller_node` / `seller_exec`
//! modules are gated behind its `wallet` feature, which is OFF by default — so `cargo test -p
//! maxplayer-core --locked --offline`, one of this repo's declared checks, does not compile (let
//! alone run) their in-crate tests. The `maxplayer` crate sets `default = ["wallet"]`, and its
//! `wallet` turns on `maxplayer-core/wallet`, so `cargo test -p maxplayer --locked --offline` — also
//! a declared check — builds this path and runs this file. The seller-side unit teeth in
//! `maxplayer-core` (store round-trip, migration, prompt composition, wire→row mapping) stay where
//! they belong and run in CI's `--features …,wallet` jobs; this one guarantees the seam is covered by
//! the declared check set itself.
//!
//! `crates/maxplayer/src/sell.rs` would be the topical home, but `mod sell` is `#[cfg(feature =
//! "acp")]` and `acp` is not a default feature either — a test there is invisible to the same checks.
//!
//! ── The bites, each applied ALONE and measured (this file, at this commit) ────────────────────────
//!   - stop persisting it (`offer.output` → `None` in `store::record_offer`'s params)  [persist]
//!     ⇒ `the_declared_output_type_is_persisted_and_reaches_the_agents_prompt` FAILS, the other two
//!       pass — it is the reopened row that goes empty, not the prompt composition.
//!   - the call site drops it (`None` for the declared output in `seller_node::run::job_prompt`)
//!     ⇒ ALL THREE FAIL.
//!   - the prompt drops it (remove `{output_section}` from `compose_agent_prompt`'s format string)
//!     ⇒ ALL THREE FAIL.
//!
//! The fourth link, WIRE → ROW (`output: Some(offer.output.clone())` in `seller_node::run::offer_row`),
//! is not reachable from here — that mapping is private to `maxplayer-core`. Biting it turns
//! `seller_node::run::tests::the_declared_output_type_survives_wire_to_row_to_prompt_across_a_restart`
//! red (measured the same way), which runs in CI's wallet-featured job.
