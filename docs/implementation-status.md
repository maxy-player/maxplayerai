# Implementation status

[`protocol-v1.md`](protocol-v1.md) defines the v1 wire. This file records where the code stands
against it today.

Every row was verified by reading the tree at the cited line. A row leaves this file when the code
matches the spec.

<!-- Re-pin at 6cf28f9bedaf. Two §6.5 ACCEPT rows left: since #697/#718, protocol-v1.md §6.5 specifies two `e` tags (root / unmarked claim) and no job-hash; `accept_draft` (gateway.rs:480) and `parse_offer_and_claim_tags` (gateway.rs:534) match that. No other row qualified. seller_node/run.rs 1739→1837 (`capture_job_checks`), 1751→1840 (`resolve_backend`), 4767→5025 (`refusal_feedback`). gateway.rs:660→659 (`pub enum ReasonCode`). Adjacent, not expanded: `parent_count()` is also asserted in tests/no_system_git.rs:185; 9 comment lines still say §10 for feedback reason codes (now §7.1; current §10 is Rejection). -->

## Trade events

| Spec | v1 says | Code today | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| §6.7 | `FEEDBACK` `status` is one of `progress`, `claim_released`, `refusal`, or `error`. | Only `error` is emitted. `error_draft` sets it (`gateway.rs:712`), and the other three literals appear nowhere in `crates/`. | — |
| §7.1 | Seven reason codes are defined. | Four are emitted. `unsupported_version`, `mint_incompatible`, and `at_capacity` are constructed nowhere outside the enum that defines them (`gateway.rs:659`). The buyer reader already handles all three (`buyer/mod.rs:2357`). | — |
| §2.1 | A reader MUST reject an event whose `v` is not `1`. | Enforced at `parse_offer` (`gateway.rs:304`) and `parse_heartbeat`. The award, accept, and result parsers gate on kind. The offer gate covers trade entry, so this is defence in depth rather than an open hole. | — |

## Delivery

| Spec | v1 says | Code today | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| §8.1 | An implementation MUST assert a parent count of one in contribution mode, and zero in greenfield mode. | No production path asserts it. The buyer verifies descent and tip-match instead — `delivery_git.rs:254`, `delivery_git.rs:308`, `delivery.rs:93`. The only `parent_count()` assertions are tests — `seller_git.rs:952`, `seller_git.rs:1049`, both inside the `#[cfg(test)]` module that opens at `seller_git.rs:804`. | — |

Container-side delivery exists behind `[sandbox] container_delivery`, default `false` (`home.rs:644`).
When the switch is on, `execute_job` calls `deliver_via_container` (`seller_node/run.rs:6062`), and one
container runs the agent and every git step. When it is off, the #937 host path runs unchanged. On
2026-09-03 one live from-scratch job passed through the container path (`fresh-after-agent` token
mode) and the buyer paid. The relay canary (`tests/relay_canary.rs`) showed that day that the relay
enforces the token's ref scope but does not yet honor its `expiration` tag. Open: Task B10 (meter usage
at the credential proxy), removal of the interim host push, and relay Requirement B (the `expiration`
tag), on which the `long-lived` token mode waits. The line numbers are from commit `519a4d0`.

## Verification checks and rejection

The checks declaration and environment-provisioning path is wired into contribution jobs. Running
the declared checks and producing or verifying their attestation remain absent from production.

| Spec | v1 says | Code today | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| §9.1 | A reader reads `.maxplayer/checks.toml` from the pinned base and validates it. | The seller's contribution-workdir path inspects the pinned base commit. If the declaration blob is absent, it returns `Ok(())` and silently skips provisioning. If present, `capture_job_checks` calls `parse_declaration` and `validate_against_base`; the path then calls `env_lock_ref` and records the declaration and resolved reference — `seller_node/run.rs:1837`. | — |
| §9.2 | A checked delivery carries an attestation the buyer verifies. | No production path calls `render_attestation` or `parse_attestation`. | — |
| §9.1 | The runner resolves an environment backend and runs declared commands with the required network posture. | The seller calls `resolve_backend` and `provision`: Nix provisioning warms the dev shell with `true`; container provisioning pulls and verifies the pinned digest; and `argv_prefix` produces the checks-posture prefix. Provisioning failures become `execution_failed` feedback with detail `env_unprovisionable` through `refusal_feedback` — `seller_node/run.rs:1840`, `seller_node/run.rs:5025`. No production path runs the declaration's `prepare` or `commands` arrays. | — |
| §10 | A buyer publishes `REJECT` on a deterministic verification failure. | No production path publishes it. `reject_draft` exists (`gateway.rs:725`) and its only caller is its own unit test (`gateway.rs:986`). | — |

The execution sentinel in §8.2 is a separate mechanism, and it **is** enforced. A buyer refuses to
spend on a delivery that carries no sentinel bound to that job (`authorize_pay.rs:441`).

## Documentation

| Item | State | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Section citations in Rust comments | 40 comment lines across `crates/` cite section numbers from an earlier layout of `protocol-v1.md`, such as `§19` for the execution sentinel. Counted as lines whose first non-whitespace is `//` (covers `//`, `///`, and `//!`) matching retired numbers `§7.0`, `§7.5`, `§17`, `§18.1`, `§19`: `git grep -nE '^\s*//.*§(7\.0|7\.5|17|18\.1|19)' -- ':(glob)crates/**/*.rs'`. The restructure changed that numbering. Updating the comments touches `.rs` files. | — |
