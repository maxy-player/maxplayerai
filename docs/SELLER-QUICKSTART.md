# Seller quickstart — zero → earning

Documented seller steps only. The key never leaves the box.

`maxplayer seller` is a seller daemon with good defaults. The **only** inputs you must choose are
**`--agent`** and **`--rate-sats`**. Everything else (relay, mint, delivery remote, key) defaults
and persists to `config.toml`, so relaunching is zero-prompt.

> **Execution prerequisite — Nix.** The node starts and claims jobs without Nix, but the hired
> agent fails at **execution** when it needs `cargo` / `nix develop` inside the workdir. Before
> serving work, run `nix --version` and confirm it succeeds.

```bash
# first run — the only two required choices; writes [seller] into config.toml
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller --agent claude --rate-sats 100

# steady state — reads config.toml, zero prompts
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller
```

What each leg does:

| Leg | What that means |
|-----|-----------------|
| marketplace | kind-3401 / 3402 / 3403 / 3404 on the marketplace relay |
| discoverability | on start the daemon publishes a kind-0 profile; capability rides the kind-30340 seat heartbeat (`d=maxplayer-seller`), republished every ~5 min, so buyers find you by capability |
| execute | agent presets (`--agent`) or `--agent-argv` are spawned as an ACP stdio agent; the agent-produced deliverable is verified before pay |
| deliver | relay-git default (NIP-34 announce → NIP-98 push) or BYO `--git-remote`; kind-3403 carries the commit OID |
| collect / pay | daemon unwraps the buyer's gift-wrapped cashu token and redeems it against the configured mint, **fee-aware** — your wallet nets `face − mint fee` (see [§7](#7-fees--rate--set---rate-sats-to-net-positive)) |

## 0. Get the binary

No toolchain needed:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/MakePrisms/maxplayerai/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
MAXPLAYER_BIN="$HOME/.local/bin/maxplayer"
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" --version   # must print a version
```

On npm: `npm install -g maxplayer` (needs Node 18+; see [npm global installs](#npm-global-installs-node-versions-and-eacces) if that fails with `EACCES`).

Building it yourself instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MakePrisms/maxplayerai.git
cd maxplayerai
nix develop -c bash -lc 'cargo build -p maxplayer --release --no-default-features --features wallet,acp'
MAXPLAYER_BIN="$(pwd)/target/release/maxplayer"
```

Or, without cloning, straight from the flake:

```bash
# nix caches the git ref — always --refresh (or pin+bump the rev) or you get a stale binary.
MAXPLAYER_BIN="$(nix build --refresh --no-link --print-out-paths github:MakePrisms/maxplayerai)/bin/maxplayer"
```

> ⚠ **Stale nix cache:** `nix run github:MakePrisms/maxplayerai -- …` without `--refresh` can serve yesterday's binary. Prefer `nix run --refresh github:MakePrisms/maxplayerai -- seller …` (or pin+bump the rev).

### npm global installs: Node versions and `EACCES`

Two things bite the npm route — for `maxplayer` itself and for the agent adapters in [§3b](#3b-setup-gotchas--two-environment-prerequisites-that-silently-break-execute) alike. The Node floor is **not
the same for both**, and this page used to quote the adapters' floor for `maxplayer` too.

**`maxplayer` needs Node 18+**, the floor its package declares in `engines.node`. Debian's stock
Node 20 is fine. The launcher is a small CommonJS shim whose own floor is lower still — Node 14.18,
for the `node:` prefix in `require()` — and it starts a statically linked binary that needs no Node
at all, so nothing in the install path requires 22.

**The third-party CLIs in [§3b](#3b-setup-gotchas--two-environment-prerequisites-that-silently-break-execute) set their own, higher floors** — `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` wants Node 22+.
That is their requirement, not `maxplayer`'s. Check before installing those:

```bash
node --version    # v18+ for maxplayer; the agent CLIs below may want more (claude-code: v22+)
```

Or take the `curl` installer above for `maxplayer`, which carries no Node dependency.

**`EACCES` on `npm i -g`.** As a non-root user the global prefix is not writable, so the install
fails with `The operation was rejected by your operating system`. Pick one:

```bash
# a user-owned global prefix (preferred — no sudo, survives future installs)
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"     # add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to persist

# or install as root
sudo npm i -g <package>
```

The user-prefix route is the one to prefer: it needs no sudo, and it puts the binaries somewhere you
control. Whichever you choose, the bin directory must be on the **daemon's** `PATH`, not only your
login shell's — see the `PATH` note in [§3b](#3b-setup-gotchas--two-environment-prerequisites-that-silently-break-execute).

---

## 0b. Fresh home + key (auto-generated, 0600, never on argv)

Isolate seller state. First run bootstraps `config.toml`, `wallet/`, and `key` (mode `0600`). The
key is **auto-generated** — you never provide one, and there is **no** `--key` flag (`--key`
/ `--secret-key` / `--private-key` are refused).

```bash
export MAXPLAYER_HOME="/tmp/maxplayer-seller-fresh-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$MAXPLAYER_HOME"
test ! -e "$MAXPLAYER_HOME/key" && echo "fresh home ok"
```

Defaults written on first bootstrap / first `maxplayer seller` run:

- **mint:** `https://mint.minibits.cash/Bitcoin`, set at first run. Jobs settle in sats as
  bitcoin-denominated ecash from that mint.
- **relay:** `wss://relay.maxplayer.ai` — the open-market relay (override in `config.toml` or via `MAXPLAYER_RELAY_URL`).
- **delivery remote:** the hosted **relay-git** (see [§4](#4-delivery--relay-git-default-or-byo)).
- **key file:** `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/key` (or `~/.maxplayer/key`) — mode `0600`, auto-generated, never printed by `maxplayer seller`.

All four are overridable in `config.toml`.

**Owner-only on disk (shared hosts).** `bootstrap` chmods `$MAXPLAYER_HOME` and `wallet/` to `0700` at
creation — on a shared host, seller state (key, mint proofs, config, job workdirs) IS the wallet, so a
group/world-readable home lets any local user read money-bearing material (#473). This is a property of
the binary, not of your `umask`, and `maxplayer doctor` has a **home permissions** leg that flags a home
that has since drifted open (WARN for a seat only its named buyers can reach, FAIL for one strangers
can reach by either open surface — see §6). The one thing the
binary cannot own is state a **harness** writes outside the seat home (e.g. a Cursor config under `~`):
run the daemon under a service unit with **`UMask=0077`** so that residue is owner-only too.

---

## 1. What you need before earning

| Item | Why | Default |
|------|-----|---------|
| An **agent** | The daemon spawns it (ACP stdio) to do the claimed job | `--agent claude\|cursor\|codex` resolves the ACP command for you |
| A **rate** | Claim floor + the amount that must clear fees to net positive | `--rate-sats <n>` — the setup default is **100**, the rate buyers post at (see [§7](#7-fees--rate--set---rate-sats-to-net-positive)) |
| A **delivery remote** | The daemon pushes the job branch there; the buyer tip-matches the commit | defaults to the hosted **relay-git**; override with `--git-remote <https>` |
| Mint | Collect redeems the buyer's gift-wrapped cashu token | `https://mint.minibits.cash/Bitcoin` (auto) |

Only `--agent` and `--rate-sats` are required on the first run. The delivery remote defaults to
relay-git, and relay / mint / key are automatic.

---

## 2. `maxplayer seller` flags

```text
Usage:
  maxplayer seller --agent <claude|cursor|codex> --rate-sats <n> [--git-remote <url>] [--claim-open-pool] [--name <display>] [--home <dir>] [--skip-doctor]
  maxplayer seller   # zero-prompt relaunch from config.toml
  maxplayer seller --agent-argv <prog> [--agent-argv <arg> ...] --rate-sats <n>   # power-user hatch

Notes:
  - required user choices: --agent (or --agent-argv) + --rate-sats (first run)
  - defaults: relay=wss://relay.maxplayer.ai mint=mint.minibits.cash git-remote=relay-git key=0600 auto
  - no --key (packaged key file only)
  - startup runs the doctor readiness gate and REFUSES to boot on a blocking failure (no working nix, agent unresolvable, no mint reachable, seller key missing, relay unreachable), each with a fix hint
  - --skip-doctor: bypass the startup readiness checks (default: checks-on; not recommended). The nix check still runs — it is an environment requirement (#745) with no bypass
  - --unsafe-no-sandbox: serve a STRANGER-FACING surface with no working sandbox (either open surface) — this box then runs code written by strangers with no containment (waives only that one check)
  - open-pool claiming is OFF by default; pass --claim-open-pool to opt in
  - --offer-backfill-secs <n>: see OPEN-POOL offers posted up to n seconds before startup (default 1200; 0 = live-only; targeted offers always backfill)
```

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| `--agent <name>` | yes* | Named preset: `claude` \| `cursor` \| `codex`. Resolves the correct ACP command internally. |
| `--agent-argv <part>` | yes* (repeatable) | Build `agent_command` as an **argv array** (first entry = program). Shell strings refused. Pass either `--agent` **or** `--agent-argv`, not both. |
| `--rate-sats <n>` | yes (first run) | Claim floor in sats + your net-positive floor. The setup default is `100` (see [§7](#7-fees--rate--set---rate-sats-to-net-positive)). |
| `--git-remote <url>` | no | Public https delivery remote (BYO). Omit → the hosted relay-git default. |
| `--claim-open-pool` | no | Opt in to claim untargeted/open-pool offers (default **off**). `--no-claim-open-pool` forces off. |
| `--accept-open-targeted` | no | Opt in to accept targeted offers from buyers you have NOT named (default **off**). `--no-accept-open-targeted` forces off. See §6 — with neither this nor an allowlist, the seat claims nothing. |
| `--name <display>` | no | Optional kind-0 display name published for discoverability. |
| `--job-timeout-secs <n>` | no | Per-job timeout (seconds). |
| `--offer-backfill-secs <n>` | no | See OPEN-POOL offers posted up to `n` seconds before startup (default `1200`; `0` = live-only; targeted offers always backfill). |
| `--skip-doctor` | no | Bypass the startup readiness checks (checks-on by default; not recommended). Does **not** bypass the nix check — that is an environment requirement (#745: "can this box EVER do the work"), so it survives every flag. |
| `--unsafe-no-sandbox` | no | Serve a stranger-facing surface (either open surface) with no working sandbox — this box then runs strangers' code uncontained. Waives that one check only. |
| `--home <dir>` | no | Home root (else `MAXPLAYER_HOME` / `~/.maxplayer`). |

\* Exactly one of `--agent` / `--agent-argv` is required on the **first** run. After that they are
persisted in `config.toml`, so a bare `maxplayer seller` relaunch needs neither.

**Zero-prompt / non-interactive.** A bare `maxplayer seller` with an existing `[seller]` config runs
straight through (zero prompts). On a **first** run without a TTY, pass `--agent` + `--rate-sats`
(the daemon errors and names the missing fields rather than hanging). `--non-interactive` forces
that fail-closed naming even in a TTY. In a TTY with no config, a short wizard prompts for the
agent and rate (rate default `100`) and then writes `[seller]`.

---

## 3. Agents — presets first, argv as the hatch

`maxplayer seller` starts your agent as an **ACP stdio agent**. You do not need to know ACP: pick a preset.

> **Sandbox the job agent.** The seller's job agent executes untrusted buyer task text. Run it
> sandboxed: no `~/.maxplayer` access, and no wallet tools or keys. Give it only the per-job workdir
> it needs to produce the deliverable.
>
> **What the sandbox does guarantee:** a stranger's code cannot reach `MAXPLAYER_HOME` — the seller
> key and the wallet. Your sats stay yours. That is the boundary the cage is built to hold, and it
> is narrower than "no host secrets."
>
> **What it does not:** an OAuth/subscription harness carries its own credential *inside* the cage —
> it cannot authenticate otherwise — so a job can read whatever the agent can read, including that
> credential. For open-pool serving prefer an API-key harness: the key is scoped and revocable, so a
> leak costs you a rotation rather than an account.

```bash
--agent claude   # adapter: claude-agent-acp on PATH  + a signed-in `claude` CLI behind it
--agent cursor   # adapter: cursor-agent (or agent) on PATH, appends `acp` + signed in
--agent codex    # adapter: codex-acp on PATH          + a signed-in `codex` CLI behind it
```

Each preset needs **two** things: the adapter binary on `PATH`, and the agent CLI behind it
authenticated. Gotcha 1 in §3b has the install and login command for each.

`--agent-argv` remains the **power-user escape hatch** for any other agent — build the argv array
yourself (repeat the flag; no shell strings, no `--key`):

```bash
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller \
  --agent-argv cursor-agent --agent-argv acp \
  --rate-sats 100
```

Per claimed job the daemon: creates a per-job workdir under `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/seller-jobs/<job_id>/`,
spawns `agent_command[0]` with `agent_command[1..]` on ACP stdio, prompts it with the offer's task
text in that workdir, and on completion pushes the tree and publishes kind-3403 with the commit OID.

> The `--agent` presets resolve to a published ACP adapter argv and feed the **same** ACP-stdio
> spawn used by the `--agent-argv` form. Deliver only agent-advanced trees — no harness-authored
> fallback commits.

---

## 3a. Link your model account

Maxplayer does not authenticate Cursor, Claude, or Codex. The ACP adapter starts the vendor CLI, and
that CLI must **already be linked to an account**. A seat with a correct `config.toml` and an
unauthenticated CLI is a seat that cannot earn.

### Rules that apply to every provider

- **Link as the seller service user, with its real `HOME` and `PATH`.** A login performed as `root` is
  invisible to a daemon running as `seller`. An `export` in an interactive shell is invisible to an
  already-running systemd service — the credential takes effect on the **restart**, not before it.
- **Keep each runner's login fresh and separate.** Do not copy another runner's credential or reuse its
  home. Credential directories should be mode `0700`; credential files and service environment files
  should be mode `0600`.
- **Subscription login and API-key login are different things.** They use different billing,
  different entitlements, and sometimes different available models. Choose deliberately.
- **`maxplayer doctor` cannot tell you the CLI is linked.** It checks configuration, binaries, images,
  and containment, and it runs **no agent turn**. The seller's pre-advertise probe does run one,
  through the same sandbox path a paid job uses, so an auth failure there keeps the seat off the board.
  A green `doctor` beside a seat that never advertises is the normal shape of an unlinked harness.
- **Never print, commit, paste into chat, or place a durable credential in `config.toml`.** On a
  headless server, share only the one-time browser URL or code through a private channel, and keep the
  login process running until approval completes.

### Cursor

For a host or `launcher` seat:

```bash
# Run as the seller service user, with its real HOME and PATH.
NO_OPEN_BROWSER=1 cursor-agent login
cursor-agent status
```

`NO_OPEN_BROWSER=1` makes a headless runner print the browser URL instead of trying to open a local
browser. Keep the command running, open the URL on a signed-in computer, approve it, and wait for the
terminal to report success.

> `NO_OPEN_BROWSER=1` environment variable are documented by Cursor at

For a Docker seat, use the **browser session file**, not `CURSOR_API_KEY`. Force file storage during
login if the platform would otherwise use a Keychain:

```bash
AGENT_CLI_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file NO_OPEN_BROWSER=1 cursor-agent login
```

⚠ **Find the session file; do not assume its path.** Cursor Agent `2026.08.25-3e8eec8` on Linux wrote
`$HOME/.config/cursor/auth.json` even with `AGENT_CLI_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file` (operator-measured,
2026-08-26), while older Cursor documentation names `$HOME/.cursor/auth.json`. Both locations are real
for some build. Locate the one **your** build wrote, then lock it down:

```bash
ls -l "$HOME/.config/cursor/auth.json" "$HOME/.cursor/auth.json" 2>/dev/null
chmod 600 <the file that exists>
cursor-agent status
```

⛔ **Do not read `doctor`'s credential-directory check as proof of this file.** It inspects the
directories Maxplayer knows for a harness; it does not open your session file, and it cannot tell you
which location your Cursor build actually uses. `stat` the configured file yourself and confirm the
owner, the mode, and that the service user can read it — without printing its contents.

Point the contained seat at the file by **absolute path**. Cursor needs **two legs**: its control plane
and its agent/inference leg go to different hosts, and one `upstream` cannot name both.

```toml
[[sandbox.file_credentials]]
path = "/absolute/path/to/.config/cursor/auth.json"   # the path YOU verified above
field = "accessToken"
env = "CURSOR_AUTH_TOKEN"
upstream = "https://api2.cursor.sh"
endpoint_args = ["--endpoint"]

[[sandbox.file_credentials.legs]]
endpoint_args = ["--agent-endpoint"]
upstream = "https://agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh"
```

If you select a **named agent pool**, pin the model on the named preset, not only on the legacy
fallback command. `agents = ["cursor"]` alone resolves the built-in preset and drops extra model
arguments:

```toml
[seller]
agents = ["cursor"]

[agents.cursor]
argv = ["cursor-agent", "--model", "cursor-grok-4.6-high", "acp"]
```

⛔ **`forward_env = ["CURSOR_API_KEY"]` is unsafe for untrusted Docker jobs.** It puts a real, reusable
key inside the job container, where a stranger's job reads it. `doctor` WARNs rather than refusing, so
the seat runs and leaks. Use the session file above instead: the per-job proxy keeps the real value on
the host and hands the container a placeholder.

The endpoint flags, the upstream hosts, and the session-file location are all **version-measured Cursor
behaviour**. Revalidate them whenever you move the pinned Cursor build.

### Claude

For a host or `launcher` seat, run `claude`, choose the Claude.ai or Console account in the browser, and
use `/login` to relink an existing install. Over SSH or in a container, copy the displayed URL into a
browser and paste the returned code back into the terminal.

```bash
claude auth status
```

> **Vendor behaviour we do not control.** Anthropic documents the current flow and its storage locations
> at <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication> (read 2026-08-26).

`/login` writes a user credential under `~/.claude` on Linux and Windows, and to the **macOS Keychain**.
That is enough for a host or `launcher` seat. It is **not visible inside Docker**: a container inherits
no home directory and no Keychain.

For an unattended Docker seller on a Claude subscription, generate the long-lived, model-only token:

```bash
claude setup-token
```

Store the result as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` in a root-owned or seller-owned mode-`0600` systemd
environment file. Never echo it into docs, logs, shell history, `config.toml`, or chat. Maxplayer's
contained Claude path takes it from the daemon environment, keeps the real value on the host, and gives
the job a per-job placeholder.

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is the **usage-billed Console path**, not a subscription login. It also needs a
one-time interactive approval that a daemon has nobody to give, which is why the OAuth token is the
right choice for an unattended seat.

### Codex

Use a **dedicated Codex home** for the seller, so its login and refresh state cannot disturb another
Codex process. Configure file storage before you log in:

```toml
# $CODEX_HOME/config.toml
cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"
```

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="/absolute/path/to/.codex-maxplayer-seller"
install -d -m 700 "$CODEX_HOME"
codex login                 # on a browser-capable host
codex login --device-auth   # on a headless host
codex login status
test -f "$CODEX_HOME/auth.json"
chmod 600 "$CODEX_HOME/auth.json"
```

> **Vendor behaviour we do not control.** OpenAI's current auth guide is
> <https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth/> (read 2026-08-26). `cli_auth_credentials_store` is Codex's
> own setting. Device-code login may need to be enabled in the user's ChatGPT security settings or by a
> workspace admin.

For Docker, **do not mount or copy `auth.json` into the job container.** Point Maxplayer at the absolute
host path:

```toml
[sandbox.codex_chatgpt]
auth_file = "/absolute/path/to/.codex-maxplayer-seller/auth.json"
```

Maxplayer reads the needed ChatGPT fields **on the host, once per job**, and sends only placeholders into
Docker. The path must be absolute; a relative one is refused at config load. If the stored access token
is close to expiry, relink or refresh it on the host — **no seller restart is needed** for the next job
to reread the file.

For usage-billed API access, use the stdin form:

```bash
printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key
```

(The removed `--api-key` flag no longer exists; `--with-api-key` and `--device-auth` do.)

### The verification gate — run this for every provider

1. Run the vendor's status command **as the exact seller service user**.
2. Check only file **existence, owner, mode, and expected JSON field shape** — never print the credential.
3. Start the seller and require the **real pre-advertise probe** to pass.
4. Confirm the signed heartbeat advertises the intended harness and model.
5. Run one small targeted canary job before opening any stranger-facing route.

## 3b. Setup gotchas — two environment prerequisites that silently break `execute`

The two failures below are **environment/setup issues, not core bugs** — the daemon and
`acp_driver` are fine; they spawn the agent and publish failure feedback exactly as designed. They
surfaced in end-to-end seller testing. If your `execute` leg never produces a tree, check these two
things **first**.

### Gotcha 1 — the agent adapter binary MUST be resolvable on `PATH`

`--agent claude|cursor|codex` resolves to a **fixed adapter command** and spawns it as the ACP
stdio agent. **There is no auto-`npx` fallback:** if that adapter binary is not found on the
daemon's `PATH`, `maxplayer seller` errors up front with an install hint and does **no** work — it does
not silently reach for `npx`.

Each preset needs a specific binary on `PATH` — **and, except for `cursor`, an underlying agent CLI
that is installed *and signed in*.** The adapter is a shim; the credentials belong to the CLI behind
it. Installing only the adapter is the most common way a fresh seat fails (see the warning below).

| `--agent` | Adapter binary that must be on `PATH` | Install adapter | Underlying CLI — install **and** authenticate |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| `claude`  | `claude-agent-acp`                     | `npm i -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` | `claude` — `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash`, or `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (**Node 22+**). Auth: run `claude` and complete `/login`, or `claude auth login`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (read the warning below), or `claude setup-token` |
| `cursor`  | `cursor-agent` (or `agent`), `acp` appended | `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS \| bash` | none extra — `cursor-agent` **is** the CLI. Auth: `cursor-agent login`, or set `CURSOR_API_KEY` |
| `codex`   | `codex-acp`                            | `npm i -g @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` | `codex` — `npm i -g @openai/codex`. Auth: `codex login`, `codex login --device-auth`, or `printenv OPENAI_API_KEY \| codex login --with-api-key`. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is also read directly |

> The `npm i -g` rows above are third-party CLIs with their own Node floors — `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
> needs **Node 22+**, higher than the **Node 18+** `maxplayer` itself asks for. They also fail with
> `EACCES` for a non-root user until you set a user-owned global prefix (or use `sudo`). Both are
> handled in [npm global installs](#npm-global-installs-node-versions-and-eacces).

> ⚠ **Do not `npm i -g cursor-agent`.** That npm package is an unrelated third party's and installs
> **no binary at all** — you get a silent success and a `cursor-agent` that is still missing. The
> real install is the `curl` line above.

The env-var forms (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CURSOR_API_KEY`) must be in the
**daemon's** environment, not just your login shell — the same `PATH` caveat below applies to
credentials.

**Two things that specifically bite an unattended seat**, where nobody is watching to answer a
prompt:

- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` alone is not enough for a hands-off seller.** Claude Code prompts **once**
  to approve a key found in the environment rather than using it silently. A daemon has no one to
  approve it, so the probe fails on a box where the variable is plainly set. Either approve it once
  interactively on that machine first, or use `/login` / `claude setup-token` so the credential is
  already stored.
- **`cursor-agent login` opens a browser.** On a headless seat set `NO_OPEN_BROWSER=1` and it prints
  the URL to complete on another machine instead.

*Verified 2026-08-05. Two of these are version-pinned and may drift: the `codex` flags were read at
`main` HEAD (not a released tag), and the `cursor-agent` behaviour at build `2026.07.09`. The
adapter packages and the `claude` auth routes are not version-sensitive in the same way.*

**Verify** (the daemon's own lookup — must print an absolute path):

```bash
command -v claude-agent-acp    # claude preset — then also: command -v claude
command -v cursor-agent        # cursor preset (or: command -v agent)
command -v codex-acp           # codex preset  — then also: command -v codex
```

These prove resolution only. **Nothing you can `command -v` proves you are logged in** — for that,
run the underlying CLI once by hand and confirm it completes a turn without asking you to
authenticate. If it prompts for login, so will the seller's probe.

**Fix** — pick one:

- **Install the adapter globally** with the `npm i -g …` line above, and make sure the npm global
  bin dir (`npm bin -g` / `npm prefix -g`/bin) is on the **daemon's** `PATH`. A systemd unit, a
  Docker/`ENTRYPOINT`, or a `cron` job usually starts with a **minimal `PATH`** that omits your
  interactive shell's — export the full `PATH` into the environment the daemon actually runs under,
  not just your login shell.
- **Or use the `--agent-argv` hatch** to point straight at a resolvable program instead of relying
  on the preset lookup, e.g.:

  ```bash
  "$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller \
    --agent-argv npx --agent-argv @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp \
    --rate-sats 100
  ```

### Gotcha 2 — on NixOS the agent path is dead without `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`

On **NixOS**, having the adapter on `PATH` (Gotcha 1) is **not enough**. The `claude-agent-acp`
adapter in turn shells out to a `claude` executable, and the npm-shipped `claude` is a
**dynamically-linked** binary that expects an FHS loader (`/lib64/ld-linux-*`) that NixOS does not
provide. So the adapter starts, tries to launch `claude`, and the exec dies — a `PATH` shim alone
cannot fix this because the problem is the interpreter/loader, not name resolution.

**Symptom:** the `execute` leg fails to start (or spawns and immediately dies); `acp_driver`
publishes failure feedback. Nothing is wrong with the marketplace/claim/deliver/collect legs — it is
purely the agent process failing to exec on this host.

**Fix — set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` to a real, NixOS-runnable `claude` binary.** Point it at a
`claude` that was built/patched for the system (e.g. one installed into the system profile) rather
than the dynamically-linked npm build:

```bash
# use the system-provided, NixOS-compatible claude
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE=/run/current-system/sw/bin/claude

# verify it actually runs on this host before starting the daemon
"$CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE" --version
```

Export `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` into the **same environment the daemon runs under** (systemd
`Environment=`, Docker `-e` / `ENV`, or the shell that launches `maxplayer seller`) — not just an
interactive shell. With it set, the adapter runs the working `claude` and the ACP/`execute` path
comes alive.

## 3c. Sandbox the job agent

The job agent executes untrusted buyer task text (see the warning in §3). **This does not happen by
default:** out of the box the daemon runs the agent as a plain child process — same user, same filesystem
access — so your `MAXPLAYER_HOME` (key + wallet) is reachable by the agent. Configure a sandbox before
serving jobs.

**Use `mode = "docker"`.** The job runs in a container mounting only the per-job workdir, and the kernel
boundary and egress containment exist in this mode and nowhere else. On macOS it is the only sandbox
there is, since bubblewrap is Linux-only.

`mode = "launcher"` — which is what a `[sandbox]` section with no `mode` line gets — is the weaker,
Linux-only path, kept below for a box that cannot run docker and for recognising a seat you already have.

### `mode = "docker"`

```toml
[sandbox]
mode = "docker"
network = "maxplayer-jobs"       # egress containment for this seat
proxy_port_range = "9100-9199"   # REQUIRED once network is set; size it >= [seller] slots
runtime = "runsc"                # gVisor; Linux only — omit on macOS
```

```bash
docker network create maxplayer-jobs        # one-time; doctor prints this command if it is missing
docker info --format '{{.Runtimes}}'        # runsc must be listed before you set runtime = "runsc"
maxplayer doctor                            # checks the image, the network and the containment probe
```

⚠ **Two things block a working docker seat, and neither is caught before a job runs.**

**1. `proxy_port_range` is mandatory once `network` is set.** Your model credential is held by a per-job
host proxy and never enters the container; the pinhole the job reaches it through is named from this
range. Without one the daemon refuses the job: *"a contained credential needs `[sandbox]
proxy_port_range` when egress containment is active — without it the firewall opens no pinhole and the
job cannot reach its model"*. Size it at least as large as `[seller] slots`, since each contained job
holds its own listener for its lifetime.

**2. An environment credential does not cross the container boundary.** A host executor inherits your
environment; a container inherits nothing. `claude /login` writes to `~/.claude` (macOS: the Keychain)
and neither exists inside the container. The daemon's **own environment** must hold that credential.
These names are forwarded in automatically when set, with no `forward_env` entry:
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. For `claude` prefer `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (`claude
setup-token`) — an environment API key needs a one-time interactive approval a daemon cannot give (§3b).

Docker Codex has a separate ChatGPT session route. `[sandbox.codex_chatgpt]` reads the host Codex auth
file for each job and keeps the real session outside Docker. See the controlled setup below.

Whether the pre-advertise probe catches this depends on your sandbox mode, because the probe runs
wherever jobs run. Under `launcher` or no sandbox it runs the CLI **on the host**, where `~/.claude` is
readable — so it passes on a credential the daemon environment is missing, and you find out at the first
job. Under `mode = "docker"` it runs **inside the container**, so it fails and the seat **never
advertises**. Set the variable where the daemon **actually starts** — a systemd `Environment=`, a launchd plist, or the launcher script that
`exec`s it. Not your login shell, and note an `export` in an interactive shell cannot reach an
already-running daemon: the credential change takes effect on the **restart**, not before it.

⛔ **`cursor` has two credentials and they are not interchangeable.** `CURSOR_API_KEY` is a real,
reusable key; the list above is claude and codex only, and the per-job proxy cannot hold it. So
**`forward_env = ["CURSOR_API_KEY"]` sends your real key into the container for a stranger's job to
read** — caught by a `doctor` WARN, not a refusal, so the seat runs and leaks. Never do that.

Use the browser-login **session** instead. `[[sandbox.file_credentials]]` reads one named field out of
the session file on the host, once per job, and gives the container a placeholder plus a redirect flag;
the real value never crosses. **This path is reported working by the maintainer, measured 2026-08-26 on
Cursor Agent `2026.08.25-3e8eec8` (Linux), and not reproduced by us.** Nobody on this project has run
`cursor-agent`; it is not installed on our build hosts. Treat it as a maintainer measurement rather than
a supported configuration, and **prove it on your own seat before you take paid work on it.** It needs a
two-leg config, because cursor's agent traffic goes to a second host (`agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh`) —
name it as a `[[sandbox.file_credentials.legs]]` entry. On macOS the session lives in the login Keychain,
which the daemon cannot read, so create the file first with `AGENT_CLI_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file cursor-agent
login`, then locate the file it wrote: that path is build-dependent, so use **[Cursor](#cursor)** above
rather than typing `~/.cursor/auth.json` from this line. The fields, the `legs` entry, the expiry
behaviour, and the per-client caveat are in [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

#### Controlled Docker Codex seller with ChatGPT auth

Use a separate seller home, Codex home, Docker network, and proxy port. This keeps the current Claude
seller home and process unchanged.

First, create a dedicated Codex login for the same ChatGPT account:

```bash
export MAXPLAYER_CODEX_AUTH="$HOME/.codex-maxplayer-test"
install -d -m 700 "$MAXPLAYER_CODEX_AUTH"
CODEX_HOME="$MAXPLAYER_CODEX_AUTH" codex login
chmod 600 "$MAXPLAYER_CODEX_AUTH/auth.json"
```

Next, build the source-test sandbox image and create its network. Run the build from the repository
root. The build compiles the `maxplayer` binary into the image, so it takes several minutes. A released
binary can omit `image` and use its versioned image instead.

```bash
docker build -f docker/maxplayer-sandbox/Dockerfile -t maxplayer-sandbox:codex-test .
docker network create maxplayer-codex-test
```

Create a new seller identity. `whoami` writes a new key inside only this home and prints public values:

```bash
export MAXPLAYER_CODEX_SELLER_HOME="$HOME/.maxplayer-codex-test"
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" whoami --home "$MAXPLAYER_CODEX_SELLER_HOME"
```

Edit `$MAXPLAYER_CODEX_SELLER_HOME/config.toml`. Keep its existing root settings. Add these sections
after you replace all angle-bracket values:

```toml
[seller]
agent_command = ["codex-acp"]
agents = ["codex"]
rate_sats = 100
git_remote = "https://relay.maxplayer.ai/git/<SELLER_HEX>/m<FIRST_16_SELLER_HEX>.git"
claim_open_pool = false
accept_offers_only_from = ["<TEST_BUYER_HEX>"]
slots = 1

[sandbox]
mode = "docker"
image = "maxplayer-sandbox:codex-test"  # source test only; omit for a released binary
network = "maxplayer-codex-test"
proxy_port_range = "9200-9200"
# runtime = "runsc"                    # Linux only; omit on macOS

[sandbox.codex_chatgpt]
auth_file = "/absolute/path/to/.codex-maxplayer-test/auth.json"
```

`<TEST_BUYER_HEX>` is the 64-character buyer public key. The buyer must also target the new seller
public key. These two checks limit the seller to controlled test jobs.

Run the checks and start only the new home:

```bash
MAXPLAYER_HOME="$MAXPLAYER_CODEX_SELLER_HOME" "$MAXPLAYER_BIN" doctor
MAXPLAYER_HOME="$MAXPLAYER_CODEX_SELLER_HOME" "$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller
```

The host reads the current access token and account ID before each Codex run. The auth file and refresh
token never enter Docker. Docker receives only two per-job placeholders.

The token must outlive the job timeout plus 15 minutes. Version one does not refresh it. Run the same
dedicated Codex login again when the lifetime check fails.

The planned refresh step will run on the host before each job. It will update the same auth file before
this reader runs. It will never put a refresh token in Docker.

**Leave `image` unset for a released binary.** Omitted, the binary uses its own version-pinned ref
(`ghcr.io/makeprisms/maxplayer-sandbox:v<installed version>`), published for every release. `image` is
for a fully custom image and is not a version selector — a bare tag like `maxplayer-sandbox:latest`
sends docker to Docker Hub, where there is nothing to pull.

`network` is the switch that turns egress containment on: the job runs in a network namespace whose rules
were installed before the job process existed, so it cannot reach your LAN, your host, or the other
containers on the box, and a job whose containment cannot be established fails rather than running
exposed. `runtime` maps to `docker run --runtime` and must be registered with the daemon — nothing checks
that before the job spawns, so confirm it with the `docker info` line above. See `DOCKER.md` for the
hardening flags every docker job gets and `SANDBOXING.md` for the architecture.

An existing seat on `launcher` is never moved by an upgrade — see *Moving an existing seat from
`launcher` to `docker`* at the end of this section.

#### Container-side delivery (the default under `mode = "docker"`)

**A docker seat delivers from inside its container.** ONE sandbox container runs the agent and every
git step: clone, completion gate, commit, and push. The host runs no git for the job. It writes the
job inputs into a per-job directory, starts the container, hands over a push token, and reads back the
commit id. Then it publishes the result as before. The host never opens a git repository the job agent
can write.

This is the default. A seat with `mode = "docker"` that does not name `container_delivery` gets it.

```toml
[sandbox]
mode = "docker"
# container_delivery = false                       # opt back into the host delivery path
# container_delivery_token = "fresh-after-agent"   # default; the other value is "long-lived"
# container_delivery_token_cap_secs = 21600        # "long-lived" only; the relay's cap, 6 h
```

`container_delivery = false` is the opt-out, and it keeps working. On that path the host clones the
base, the container runs the agent, and the host commits and pushes.

**Root posture.** A seat whose daemon runs as root (uid 0) runs the job as root inside the
container, where the boundary between the job and the delivery orchestrator is weakest. Such a seat
does not get container delivery by default. It must set `container_delivery = true` to opt in, and
the boot line warns when it does. Run the seller as a non-root user.

**A `launcher` seat is not affected, and cannot use this mode.** Launcher mode creates no container to
move the git steps into, so such a seat always delivers from the host. Adding
`container_delivery = false` to a launcher seat changes nothing and is accepted;
`container_delivery = true` under `launcher` is REFUSED at boot, and so is either token key. An
upgrade never moves a launcher seat.

The seller prints the effective path at boot, on one line, so you can read it off a boot scroll:

```text
seller node delivery path: CONTAINER — one container runs the agent and every git step. This is the default for [sandbox] mode = "docker", and this seat does not set container_delivery. Set container_delivery = false for the host path.
```

The line names the path in capitals (`CONTAINER` or `HOST`) and the reason: the docker default, an
explicit `container_delivery` value, or `mode = "launcher"`. The `relay token policy` row of
`maxplayer doctor` reports the same answer.

Requirements:

- `mode = "docker"`. The seller refuses `container_delivery = true` and both token keys under
  `launcher` mode.
- A non-root seller uid, or an explicit `container_delivery = true`. A root daemon (uid 0) runs the
  job as root inside the container, so the default does not apply to it.
- A sandbox image that contains the `maxplayer` binary at `/usr/local/bin/maxplayer`. The shipped
  image has it. A custom image must add it, or set `container_delivery = false`.
- A relay that enforces the branch scope on push tokens (PR #929).

The token mode selects when the host mints the branch-scoped push token:

- `fresh-after-agent` (the default). The container reports that the agent has exited and the delivery
  commit is gated. The host then mints a 60-second token and writes it into the per-job directory. The
  container reads the token and pushes. This mode works with the relay as deployed today.
- `long-lived`. The host mints one token before the container starts. The token expires at the job
  deadline plus 5 minutes. The relay must accept the token's `expiration` tag for scoped tokens
  (relay Requirement B). The host refuses to start the job when the token lifetime exceeds
  `container_delivery_token_cap_secs`.

##### `long-lived` needs a relay that advertises support

**As of 2026-09-03 the deployed relay does NOT honor the `expiration` tag.** The relay refuses a
scoped token older than 60 seconds with HTTP 401, even when the token carries a future `expiration`.
Use `fresh-after-agent` on that relay.

A relay that does honor the tag advertises the cap it applies in its NIP-11 `limitation` object, as
`scoped_token_max_lifetime_secs`. The seat reads that field before it advertises:

- The seat REFUSES to boot in `long-lived` mode when the field is absent, when its value is smaller
  than `container_delivery_token_cap_secs`, or when the relay cannot be read at all. The refusal names
  the mode and tells you to use `fresh-after-agent`.
- `fresh-after-agent` reads nothing over the network. It depends on no relay feature, so no relay
  answer can block a boot in that mode.

The refusal happens at boot, and never in the middle of a paid job. Before this gate, a config flip
to `long-lived` caused an HTTP 401 on the push. The push is the last step of a job, and it runs after
the agent ran and after the buyer paid.

The `relay token policy` row of `maxplayer doctor` reports the same answer. The row is information
under `fresh-after-agent`, and it FAILs under `long-lived`. A docker seat reaches the row by default.
A seat on the host delivery path — a `launcher` seat, or `container_delivery = false` — reads the
config only and asks no relay.

To measure a relay yourself, run the canary test. It pushes with the production push path and prints
what the relay did with a scoped token that carries an `expiration` tag:

```bash
MAXPLAYER_CANARY_KEY_FILE=/path/to/key \
MAXPLAYER_CANARY_REMOTE=https://<relay>/git/<owner>/<repo> \
  cargo test -p maxplayer-core --features git-delivery --test relay_canary -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The last line reads `CANARY VERDICT A=<...> B=<...>`. `B=deployed` means the relay honors the
`expiration` tag; `B=not-deployed` means `long-lived` cannot work there.

Watch these lines in the seller log for one job:

```text
seller node execute job_id=… : container delivery started container=maxplayer-job-… token=FreshAfterAgent
seller node execute job_id=… : agent done in container, gated commit=<oid>
seller node execute job_id=… : fresh push token handed to the container
seller node execute job_id=… : container outcome status=Delivered exit=exit status: 0 detail=
seller node delivered job_id=… commit=<oid> agent=… result enqueued
```

The per-job directory is `$MAXPLAYER_HOME/seller-delivery/<job_id>`. The host creates it with mode
`0700`, writes the inputs file and the token file with mode `0600`, and removes the directory when the
job ends. The container's diagnostics land in `seller-diagnostics/<job_id>` as for every docker job.

Known limits of this mode:

- Every process inside the container runs as one uid. A process the agent leaves behind can read every
  file the orchestrator can read. The orchestrator therefore deletes the inputs file before it starts
  the agent, kills every other process before it requests the token, and reads the token only after
  that. The token can push only the seller's own delivery branch, so a leaked token cannot reach any
  other ref.
- The container clones a contribution base without a credential. A base repository that requires an
  authenticated fetch is not supported in this mode.
- The `checks.toml` environment provisioning step of a contribution base does not run in this mode.
- The usage and model metadata on the result come from the container's report. Metering at the
  credential proxy is a follow-up.

### `launcher` mode — only if this box cannot run docker

The launcher below is `bwrap` (bubblewrap), and it is not present on a stock box. Install it before
you configure the section, or the boot gate refuses to start a seat strangers can reach — one that
claims the open pool OR accepts targeted offers from buyers it has not named:

```bash
command -v bwrap            # prints a path once installed

sudo apt install bubblewrap     # debian / ubuntu
sudo dnf install bubblewrap     # fedora / rhel
nix profile install nixpkgs#bubblewrap   # nix
```

Any launcher works — bubblewrap is what the examples use because it needs no daemon and no root.

#### The `launcher` argv

Under `mode = "launcher"` the `launcher` key is an argv array that the daemon prepends to the agent
command, so the agent runs inside that launcher:

```toml
[sandbox]
launcher = ["bwrap",
  "--unshare-all", "--die-with-parent",
  "--ro-bind", "/usr", "/usr",
  "--ro-bind", "/lib", "/lib",
  "--ro-bind", "/bin", "/bin",
  "--ro-bind", "/etc/resolv.conf", "/etc/resolv.conf",
  "--proc", "/proc", "--ro-bind", "/sys", "/sys", "--dev", "/dev", "--tmpfs", "/tmp",
  "--bind", "/path/to/job-workdirs", "/path/to/job-workdirs",
  "--chdir", "/path/to/job-workdirs",
  "--share-net",
]
```

This bubblewrap example gives the agent a mount namespace where `~/.maxplayer` (and everything else in your
home directory) simply doesn't exist — only the OS binaries read-only and the job workdir area writable.
Adapt the paths: bind your daemon's per-job workdir location (`$MAXPLAYER_HOME/seller-jobs/<job_id>/`), add
`--ro-bind` entries for whatever the agent binary needs to run, and drop `--share-net` if the agent
doesn't need network. Any launcher works — the daemon just runs `launcher... <agent command...>`. The
`--proc /proc` and `--ro-bind /sys /sys` binds are load-bearing: the Claude runtime reads both at startup
and aborts the boot probe without them (read-only is enough — it never writes them; #470).

### Rules and failure modes

- **Pass-through = omit the section.** No `[sandbox]` section means the agent runs directly, unsandboxed.
  That is the only intended way to opt out.
- **`launcher = []` is rejected at parse — the daemon won't start** (you'll see
  `argv must be non-empty`, with the parse error naming `sandbox.launcher` — #381). It fails loudly,
  so there is no silent-empty footgun; opt out
  **only** by omitting the section.
- **A seat serving the OPEN POOL must be contained, and this is checked at boot.** `maxplayer seller`
  runs the launcher and reads what it did: a file beside your key must be unreadable from inside it,
  and the job workdir must be writable. Fail either leg and the seat refuses to start (#451).
  `launcher = ["env"]` resolves perfectly and confines nothing — it is refused on the second leg,
  not the first.
- **Seats only their named buyers can reach stay advisory.** With BOTH open surfaces off
  (`claim_open_pool` and `accept_open_targeted`), the same probe reports as a WARN: every job comes
  from a buyer you listed, rather than from whoever the market sends. That softening is bought by the
  allowlist — opening **either** surface makes this a blocking FAIL, because a targeted job from an
  unnamed buyer is the same stranger-written task text an open-pool job is.
- **The escape hatch is one flag, and it is narrow on purpose.** `maxplayer seller --unsafe-no-sandbox`
  serves strangers uncontained. It waives THIS check only — the relay, mint, key and agent gates
  stay blocking, so accepting the code-execution exposure never means switching the rest off.

### Verify before going live

The boot gate runs this for you, but you can run it by hand — it is the same probe, so a green here
is the same thing `maxplayer seller` checks at boot:

```sh
maxplayer doctor            # look for: PASS sandbox containment
```

A launcher that passes has to bind two things: the job tree (`$MAXPLAYER_HOME/seller-jobs`) so the agent
can work, and the `maxplayer` binary so the probe can run inside it. Binding your whole `MAXPLAYER_HOME`
fails the probe, correctly — your key is in there. A working shape:

```toml
[sandbox]
launcher = ["bwrap",
  "--unshare-all", "--die-with-parent",
  "--ro-bind", "/usr", "/usr", "--ro-bind", "/bin", "/bin", "--ro-bind", "/lib", "/lib",
  "--ro-bind", "/path/to/maxplayer", "/path/to/maxplayer",
  "--bind", "/home/you/.maxplayer/seller-jobs", "/home/you/.maxplayer/seller-jobs",
  "--proc", "/proc", "--ro-bind", "/sys", "/sys", "--dev", "/dev", "--tmpfs", "/tmp",
  "--share-net",
]
```

★ On some hosts bubblewrap installs cleanly and then FAILS at spawn — `setting up uid map: Permission
denied`, the AppArmor unprivileged-userns restriction on Ubuntu 24.04. The launcher resolves; it
confines nothing, because it never runs. The boot gate catches that as an unusable launcher rather
than passing it, which is the reason it runs the launcher instead of looking for the file.

### Moving an existing seat from `launcher` to `docker`

**An upgrade never moves you.** A `[sandbox]` section with `launcher` keeps working on every new version
and keeps passing the boot gate, so a seat configured before docker mode existed stays on the weaker
boundary until you change it deliberately.

Replace `launcher` with the docker keys rather than keeping both — `launcher` is unused under
`mode = "docker"`, and leaving it in place only misleads the next person to read the file:

```toml
[sandbox]
mode = "docker"
network = "maxplayer-jobs"
proxy_port_range = "9100-9199"   # required alongside network; >= [seller] slots
runtime = "runsc"                # Linux only
```

```bash
docker network create maxplayer-jobs
maxplayer doctor
```

**Check your credential before restarting.** A seat that has run on `launcher` may be authenticated only
through `~/.claude`, which a container cannot read. That is the usual cause of a switched seat that comes
back up and **never advertises**: the pre-advertise probe now runs inside the container, finds no
credential, and holds the seat off the board. `doctor` stays green throughout — it runs no agent turn —
so read the probe, not `doctor`. See the two blockers above, and link the account first: [§3a](#3a-link-your-model-account).

Then restart the daemon. Two more things to expect on a seat that is already earning: the first job pulls
the sandbox image unless it is already local (`doctor` warns and hands you the `docker pull` so you can do
it up front), and under gVisor a dependency-install-heavy job runs slower than on the host. Switch one
seat, watch it claim and deliver, then move the rest.

---

## 4. Delivery — relay-git default, or BYO

**Default (the hosted relay-git).** With no `--git-remote`, the daemon delivers to a self-owned
namespace on the marketplace relay:

```text
https://relay.maxplayer.ai/git/<seller-pubkey>/m<seller-pubkey-short>.git
```

On start it (1) publishes a **NIP-34** repo announcement (kind-30617) *before* any push — the relay
FORBIDs pushing to an un-announced repo — then (2) probes `git ls-remote` to confirm the repo was
seeded, and later (3) pushes the job branch over **NIP-98** auth signed **in-process via libgit2**
(the seller key signs the `Authorization` header in-process; the secret never touches argv, a child
process env, or a log).

> **No external `git` or helper needed.** Every seller git leg — announce, seed probe,
> and delivery push — runs in-process via libgit2 with NIP-98 signed from the seller key. There is
> no `git-credential-nostr` requirement and no system-`git` dependency; nothing to install.

**BYO (`--git-remote <https>`).** Bring your own public https remote:

- Must be **public https** (the buyer tip-matches with `git ls-remote`; no SSH / `insteadOf` games).
- After execute, the daemon pushes the branch and publishes kind-3403 carrying `repo` / `branch` / `commit`.
- Buyer acceptance compares an independent tip OID to that commit.

---

## 5. Discoverability — buyers find you by capability

On start (after `[seller]` is written) the daemon publishes:

- a **kind-0** profile, fail-closed — boot aborts if it cannot be published (a
  `maxplayer-seller-<short>` name is filled if you did not pass `--name`), and
- once the node is live, a **seat heartbeat** (**kind 30340**, `d=maxplayer-seller`) republished every
  ~5 min, carrying the tags `d` / `t` / `v` / `rate` / `accepting` / `queue_depth` / `accepted_mints`,
  plus `agents` when your seat states a harness roster and `takes_payment` when it works for free. Each beat is best-effort: a failed publish is
  logged and the next beat retries.

So buyers discover the seller **by capability**, not by hand-swapping a pubkey. The heartbeat is
addressable (same `d` every beat), so each one supersedes the last in place — republishing on that
cadence is not spam. Buyers resolve it by `(pubkey, d)`, never by event id.

Most facts on a beat are current as of that beat, but **two are not**, and it matters if you are
tuning a live seat:

- `harness_model` is the model each harness **last reported** — recorded when a harness is probed at
  boot, when a dropped harness comes back, and when a job finishes. Between those it repeats the
  last value it saw.
- `capabilities` is measured **once, at seat start**, and republished unchanged for the life of the
  process. Install a toolchain into a running seat and it is not advertised until you restart;
  remove one and the seat keeps advertising it until you restart. **Restart the seat after you
  change its toolchain**, or the advertisement and the machine disagree.

`docs/protocol-v1.md` §4.5.4 is normative for both.

### Working for free — `takes_no_payment`

A seat can advertise that it takes **no payment at all**, so a buyer holding zero bitcoin can hire
it. It is off by default and it is a config edit, not a flag:

```toml
[seller]
rate_sats = 0            # required: the pairing below is refused otherwise
takes_no_payment = true
```

Two things change, and only these two. The seat admits offers that carry
`["param","payment","none"]`, and its beat gains `["takes_payment","none"]` so free buyers can find
it. Everything else — delivery, verification, the result event — is identical to a paid job.

**`rate_sats = 0` alone does NOT do this.** `rate` is a floor, so `0` means "I accept any amount,
including nothing" — which is not the same statement as "I take nothing", and a buyer with no sats
cannot act on the first. A seat at `rate_sats = 0` that never set `takes_no_payment` refuses every
free offer, and the skip line tells you which knob to set. `takes_no_payment = true` alongside a
non-zero `rate_sats` is refused at startup: that pair describes a seat no buyer can satisfy in
either mode.

⚠ **Admission becomes your only control.** The price floor is the market's one natural throttle and
this sets it aside. There are deliberately no caps, no rate limits and no quotas. With
`claim_open_pool = true` a free seat claims every well-formed free offer in the pool until its slots
fill, and `slots` bounds how many run at once, not how many arrive. What scopes who can reach you is
admission — `accept_offers_only_from`, `accept_open_targeted`, `claim_open_pool` ([§6](#6-open-pool--claiming-untargeted-offers)).
The cost of a free job is entirely yours: compute, egress, and whatever your harness provider bills.

The brake is not claiming: a seat whose slots are full simply does not claim, and its beat still says
`accepting=y` because `accepting` means the seat is serving, not that it has room. Only a seat with
nothing serving publishes `accepting=n`, and even that is not instant: the beat is addressable and
buyers weigh it by age, so there is a cadence-sized window where a stale `accepting=y` still attracts
offers.

**You still need a mint — on the beat, and on the way up.** `accepted_mints` stays required on the
beat: a seat that publishes none does not parse for ANY buyer, free or paid, so a free seat still
names a mint it will never be paid at. *That* part is cosmetic, and relaxing it would make a
genuinely unpayable priced seat parseable. The boot requirement behind it is not cosmetic, and
`takes_no_payment = true` does not waive it.

**The mint must be `https://` and it must be reachable.** A non-`https://` URL is refused whatever
`allow_real_mints` is set to. Reachability is then a startup check in its own right: the doctor gate
probes every accepted mint and asks "can this seat settle anywhere at all" — all reachable is a
`Pass`, some reachable is a `Warn`, and none configured or none reachable is a `Fail`
(`no accepted mint reachable — cannot settle anywhere`). A `Fail` refuses boot
([§2](#2-maxplayer-seller-flags)), so a free seat with a dead mint dies at startup and never
advertises at all — the same gate, on the same terms, as a paid seat.

**So name the mint you would actually want to be paid at.** A placeholder that happens to answer
today buys you nothing: the mint you configure is the wallet this seat opens, and it is where you
top up with bitcoin later. Working for free now is not a decision to stay unpaid, so pick the mint
you would keep if you turned `takes_no_payment` back off.

**Free jobs sit at `delivered` forever.** A free job never advances to `paid` and publishes no
receipt, so it leaves your public settlement history unchanged. Local tooling that reads
"delivered but not paid" as money owed must read the delivery row's `payment` column first.

**To see what the market actually owes you, use the store's arrears read — not a hand-rolled
"delivered but no receipt" query.** `SellerStore::arrears()` returns exactly the jobs that are
actually delivered, unpaid, and not free: it excludes `deliveries.payment = 'none'`, resolves the
legacy `NULL` payment as priced (same as every other reader), and counts only rows that have a
`deliveries` record and no matching `receipts` row. It is a query and nothing more — it never
moves money or changes state. Use it alongside, not instead of, the usual job-state reporting
(`health()`, `resumable_jobs()`): those answer "what jobs exist in what state", while `arrears()`
answers "what work did I actually deliver that nobody paid for". Call it before you report any
amount as owed, so a free job's terminal `delivered` state is never counted as a debt.

### Getting your first jobs — be introduced, don't wait

Being discoverable is not the same as being hired. Buyers target the sellers they already know:
offers on the market carry a `#p` tag naming one seller, and a seat with no history is not the seat
they name. Advertising and waiting is how a new seller earns nothing.

So make the introduction yourself. Print your identity and give the npub to a buyer you know, and ask
them to target you:

```bash
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" whoami
# pubkey: <hex>
# npub:   npub1…
# home:   …
```

A buyer targets you by passing that pubkey as `seller_pubkey` when they post. Those first targeted
jobs are what build the record other buyers read.

The open pool ([§6](#6-open-pool--claiming-untargeted-offers)) is the other direction, and it
is not the cold-start path: it is where established seats compete on rate, and `doctor` requires a
working sandbox before a seat claims there. Get targeted work first.

---

## 6. Who can reach you — three independent knobs

**A fresh seat claims nothing until you say who may reach it.** Both ways a stranger can hand this
box work are opt-in, and neither is inferred from the other or from a field being empty:

```toml
[seller]
accept_offers_only_from = []       # the buyers you name. Default: none named.
accept_open_targeted    = false    # may a buyer you did NOT name target you directly?
claim_open_pool         = false    # may you claim untargeted offers from the open pool?
```

| You want | Set |
| --- | --- |
| Work only with buyers you know | `accept_offers_only_from = ["<buyer-hex>", …]` |
| Take targeted offers from anyone | `accept_open_targeted = true` |
| Compete for untargeted pool offers | `claim_open_pool = true` |

The CLI flags mirror the defaults — both are opt-INs, so the safe posture needs no flag at all:

```bash
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller --agent claude --rate-sats 100 --accept-open-targeted   # accept strangers
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller --agent claude --rate-sats 100 --claim-open-pool        # claim the pool
```

**The three knobs are additive — each admits on its own, and none cancels another** (#923). The
allowlist admits the buyers you name. `accept_open_targeted` **additionally** admits targeted offers
from buyers you did *not* name, whether or not the list has entries. `claim_open_pool` independently
permits open-pool claims. Admission is checked before the rate and harness gates: an offer that no
knob admits is skipped (`NotAllowlisted`), silently — a private seller does not tell a stranger why
it declined. Because a list and an open flag are now both in effect at once, there is no inert
combination left for `doctor` to report; its **seat reachability** line names the routes that are
open.

⚠ **So naming buyers does not fence the other surfaces.** With `accept_offers_only_from` populated
*and* `accept_open_targeted = true`, a buyer you never named can still reach this box and run code
on it. If you want only the buyers you named, leave both flags `false`.

> ⚠ **Upgrading an existing seat? Read this.** An empty `accept_offers_only_from` used to mean
> *accept from any buyer* on the targeted surface. It no longer does — it means *no buyer named*. A
> seat with no allowlist and neither flag set will **stop claiming targeted work after the upgrade**:
> it still boots, connects and advertises, it just never claims. There is no config error, because the
> config is valid. The daemon says so loudly at boot and `maxplayer doctor` fails the **seat
> reachability** check. To restore the old behaviour, either list your buyers or set
> `accept_open_targeted = true`.

**Neither flag is a security boundary, and `#p` never was one.** `#p` names *you*; it does not name
*who may post*. A targeted job from an unnamed buyer runs the same stranger-written task text an
open-pool job does, through the same agent, with the same filesystem and credentials — which is why
opening *either* surface makes containment ([SANDBOXING.md](SANDBOXING.md)) a blocking `doctor` check
rather than an advisory one. The allowlist is the control over *who* reaches you; containment is the
control over what they can do once they have.

**What changes when you opt in:** your seat can now *lose*. A targeted offer names you and nobody
else, so a claim you park is a claim you win. An open-pool offer is claimed by several seats and the
buyer picks one, so your seat also sees the buyer's AWARD and ACCEPT for offers **another seat won** —
by design, since that is how a losing seat learns to free its execution slot. The daemon binds a job
only when the award or accept names **your** published claim; a foreign one releases your claim
instead. If it ever bound one of those, the seat would publish a `queue_depth` that never drops
while no agent process runs, so a seat that shows queued work with no agent process is worth reporting.

---

## 7. Fees & rate — set `--rate-sats` to net positive

`--rate-sats` is your **claim floor**: the daemon only claims an offer whose face amount is
`≥ rate_sats`. But the sats that land in your wallet are **not** the face amount — the mint charges
an **input fee** on redeem:

> **wallet net = face − mint fee**

On a typical keyset the fee is **1 sat** for small amounts:

| Offer face | Mint fee | Wallet net |
|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|
| 1 sat | 1 sat | **refused (dust)** |
| 2 sats | 1 sat | **1 sat** |
| 15 sats | ~1 sat | **~14 sats** |

- **`--rate-sats ≥ mint_fee + 1`** is the *technical* minimum to net positive — with a 1-sat fee that is `2`. A rate of `1` is economic dust (`amount ≤ fee`); such jobs are **refused up front** before any swap, so you never spend-then-fail.
- **The setup default is `100`, and that is the number to start from.** Clearing the fee is not the same as being paid what the work is worth: buyers post at 100 sats, so a rate of `2` nets you a sat while advertising your work at 2% of the going rate. Set it lower than 100 only if you deliberately want to undercut the market.
- The **receipt / journal records the FACE (offer) amount**, not your wallet net. The face is the accounting figure; the **sats you receive are `face − fee`**. Do not read the receipt's face number as "sats pocketed."

### Platform fee (recorded at collect; paid automatically by your node)

The product charges a platform fee on each payment you collect. **The rate is set by the product,
in the binary, and you cannot change it** — there is no config key, no environment variable and no
flag for it. **The rate is 10%.** Collection records what that comes to, and **your node then pays it
automatically**: once a payment has landed and its receipt is journaled, the node makes a best-effort
attempt to remit the whole unremitted balance to the platform's Lightning address. You do not have to
remember to pay; there is nothing to run.

**The fee is 10% of the offer amount — the price the buyer paid — not of what lands in your
wallet.** The mint's own input fee (described above) is a separate deduction and does not shrink the
base: on a 100-sat offer the platform fee is 10 sats whether the mint kept 0 or 1 of those 100. The
daemon rounds the fee **down** to whole sats — a payment too small to owe a whole sat owes `0` — and
records it beside the receipt in `seller.sqlite` (`receipts.fee_bps` is the rate in force, in basis
points; `receipts.fee_sats` is what it came to; `receipts.mint_fee_sats` is the mint's fee).

**Every number is shown, so you never have to do the arithmetic.** Run

```
maxplayer seller fees [--home <dir>]
```

and each collected job prints four figures with plain labels: **what the buyer paid** (the offer
amount), **mint fee**, **platform fee (10%)** with whether it is unremitted or which remittance paid
it, and **you keep** (`paid − mint fee − platform fee`), plus the totals — the platform fee split
into remitted and unremitted — and every remittance so far. The `seller node collect ok` log line
carries the same figures (`amount_received=` is what the buyer paid, then `mint_fee=`, `fee_sats=`,
`fee_bps=`, `kept=`). Jobs collected before the mint fee was recorded print `mint fee: not recorded`
and no "you keep" figure, rather than a made-up zero.

**How the automatic remittance behaves.** A 100-sat offer with a 1-sat mint fee, for example, records
`amount_sats = 100, mint_fee_sats = 1, fee_bps = 1000, fee_sats = 10`, prints `you keep: 89 sats`, and
the 10 sats are now **unremitted** platform fee. Right after that receipt is written — and only after
a *new* receipt, never on a replayed payment — the node starts one remittance attempt on a thread of
its own:

- It resolves the platform's Lightning address over LNURL-pay (the address is fixed in the binary,
  not configurable — a seller-editable address would let a seller pay the fee to itself), reads the
  destination's minimum, and **if the unremitted balance is below that minimum it does nothing**: a
  10% fee on payments under 10 sats owes under 1 sat, and small balances simply accumulate until they
  clear the minimum. That is the expected steady state for small jobs, not an error.
- Otherwise it takes a melt quote from your default mint and invoices **the largest amount the
  wallet can actually pay for at most the accrued fee**: the mint's melt fee reserve and the proof
  fees come out of it (a mint that charges per input proof, or one whose proofs do not fit the
  amount and need a swap first). The wallet SDK (CDK) *estimates* the proof fee before paying and
  *recomputes* it on the proofs its swap hands back, refusing after the swap if they fall short — so
  the planner runs that recomputation itself and picks an amount that survives it (the plan prints
  both figures: `expected proof fees (SDK estimate, bounded exactly at payment): N sats; actual
  proof input fee the SDK recomputes on the swapped proofs: M sats ⇒ worst case W sats leaves the
  wallet (≤ G)`). **You never pay more than the fee you accrued; every fee comes out of that amount,
  not on top of it.** It then journals
  the attempt in `seller.sqlite` (`fee_remittances`: gross, melt fee, net, the address literal,
  melt quote id, payment hash, state, which process owns the attempt, and when it was admitted to
  spend), pays the invoice from your ecash through the wallet's gated melt (the same
  `allow_real_mints` gate `maxplayer wallet melt` honours), and marks the receipts it covered as
  discharged. **The accrued fee is a hard ceiling on everything that leaves the wallet, enforced
  before any ecash is spent**, in one sequence: first the payment quote's **invoice plus the mint's
  fee reserve alone** is checked against the gross (a reserve that grew past it is refused here); if
  the live reserve differs from the estimate and the planned amount would no longer confirm, the
  attempt re-plans once onto a new invoice; then the wallet prepares the payment locally — reserving
  proofs; it may fetch the mint's fee table, but sends no proofs and pays no fee yet — and the node
  re-runs the SDK's post-swap arithmetic on the prepared figures: the bound is the **actual** proof
  input fee the SDK recomputes on the proofs its swap hands back, so **the invoice plus the reserve
  plus that actual input fee plus any pre-melt swap fee** must fit the gross, and the payment is
  refused if the SDK would fail after its swap. The SDK's *prepared* fee display is not the bound: a
  prepared total over the gross whose actual debit fits is paid. On any of these refusals the
  prepared payment (if any) is cancelled — the proofs go back to unspent — before any ecash is
  consumed; the journaled row is left as it was, still planned with its receipts pinned, the refusal
  is journaled, and the next attempt's reconciliation releases that row (it was this process's own
  earlier attempt) and re-quotes. After a payment the report counts the SDK's fee once — `melt fee taken by
  the mint` already includes the actual proof input fee — and prints `actual debit: D sats = net +
  melt fee + swap fee`; if the wallet cannot read its balance afterwards it prints `wallet balance
  now: unknown (…)` rather than a guessed number. **Known bound:** the mint can change its fee
  table between the preparation and the payment and the SDK accepts no caller maximum; if that
  happens the payment can fail after its swap (the swap fee is lost and the row stays held until
  the mint says PAID or an operator decides) or cost more than predicted (a `WARNING` line). Not
  observed on any mint; disclosed, not solved. Also owed: if cancelling a prepared payment itself
  fails, a local proof reservation can remain — reopening the wallet does not clear it — until a
  supported recovery path exists. (The operator's plain `maxplayer wallet melt` keeps its older
  check — invoice plus reserve only — and is not changed by this.)
- **It cannot affect the payment it followed.** Your receipt is written and the job is marked paid
  before the attempt starts. If the attempt fails — the mint is down, the payout host is unreachable,
  the wallet is short, no route — the failure is written to the node log and journaled
  (`fee_remit_attempts`), and the balance stays unremitted. **The node then retries on its own clock,
  for as long as it runs**: after a failure the next attempt comes within a minute, and the ceiling
  on the wait then doubles — 2, 4, 8, 16 minutes — up to once every 30 minutes, each delay
  randomised between zero and that ceiling so a fleet of sellers does not hit a recovering host in
  the same second. A success resets the clock to its 30-second base; a balance under the
  destination's minimum is not a failure and does not lengthen it. Nothing runs at startup: the
  first check comes between 30 and 60 seconds after boot, and a payment collected in those first
  seconds cannot pull it earlier — the 30-second floor holds. The retries live inside the node's
  main loop, so stopping the node stops them from being scheduled — and a payment already in flight
  when you stop the node is **drained, not cut off**: once serving has ended the node waits up to 60
  seconds for the attempt to finish (ecash that may already be with the mint is never abandoned
  mid-payment), and if that wait runs out it logs one incident line and exits while the attempt
  finishes on its own. The next collected payment also tries again with the whole accumulated
  balance. An attempt interrupted mid-payment is reconciled with the mint on the next attempt:
  settled if the mint reports the payment landed. An attempt that never reached the point of
  spending is released if its quote failed or expired, or if the process that owned it is provably
  gone. An attempt that DID reach the point of spending — the store admitted it and bound the one
  mint quote it may pay — is **held**, however long, on anything but the mint saying PAID: not
  released on "expired", not on "failed", not on any clock. We do not infer that a payment is dead
  from a clock, because the mint pays a quote it calls unpaid or failed regardless of its expiry,
  and a payment prepared before the expiry can land after it; releasing on either would let the
  same balance be paid twice. Two processes sharing one store — the node and a hand-run
  `maxplayer seller fees remit --confirm`, say — pay an accrued balance once, not twice: at most one
  remittance can be in flight (a second cannot even be planned while one exists), the receipts it
  covers are pinned to it, only the process that planned it may pay it, it passes a single
  compare-and-set in the store immediately before spending which also fixes the one mint quote it
  may pay, and it never pays under any other quote; a second process asks the mint about that exact
  quote and holds off unless it is PAID, and every release is written as a condition on the row, so
  a release decided on a stale reading changes nothing. A held attempt is visible, not silent:
  `maxplayer seller fees remit` prints one `HELD:` line naming the row, the quote, what the mint said
  (unpaid, failed, pending, unknown, or a quote the wallet does not know — the same one line for each)
  and how many sats are pinned, and exits 3 — on the dry run too. Clearing it is an operator's
  decision, and there is no command for it yet; until then the node's later attempts are refused and
  the balance accumulates unremitted behind the held row. This is what the module's two-process tests
  prove, and its bound: two processes, each on its own connection to one store, against one fake mint
  that accepts unpaid or failed quotes regardless of expiry as the inspected CDK 0.17.2 mint
  implementation does (pauses after the plan, after the quote, after the gate, inside the payment
  after the wallet's last local check, and between a release decision and its write; the lease and
  the quote expiring while paused; distinct invoices; funds for a second payment present; actual
  melts counted). What the two processes share is stated per test in the module's documentation,
  not assumed: all of them share the one store; the fake mint's quote registry is shared in seven
  (the live-owner, expired-estimate, expired-quote-held, paused-owner, stale-snapshot, full-path and
  delayed-payment cases); one clock is handed from the first process to the second in four of those
  (expired-quote-held, paused-owner, stale-snapshot, delayed-payment) while the other three leave
  each process its own clock; and only the delayed-payment case also shares one wallet's proofs
  between the two. They do not run a real mint or a real wallet, and no deployed mint's behaviour
  was measured — the mint behaviour they model is read from the pinned CDK 0.17.2 source.
- **The log stays readable while it retries.** Every attempt gets at most one line. The first
  failure's line carries its detail — the destination, the balance it saw, the error — and the
  backoff it starts; later attempts in the same streak get one line each (how many have failed,
  when the next is; the moment the delay reaches its 30-minute cap is said on that same line); and
  the success that ends a streak says how many attempts failed and for how long the fee sat owed —
  the line to look for when you ask "did it ever go out?".

**The off switch.** If you need to stop the automatic payout — a misbehaving mint, an incident — set

```toml
[platform_fee]
auto_remit = false      # or MAXPLAYER_PLATFORM_FEE__AUTO_REMIT=false
```

and restart the node. One flag covers both automatic paths — the attempt after each payment and the
retry clock. This is an **operational valve, not a waiver**: the fee keeps accruing on every payment,
stays owed, and stays visible in `maxplayer seller fees`; when you turn the switch back on the next
attempt (a collect, or the retry clock's first check) remits the whole accumulated balance. The switch
cannot change the rate or the address — the `[platform_fee]` table has no key for either.
`maxplayer seller fees remit --confirm` still pays by hand while it is off.

**Inspecting and forcing a remittance by hand.** `maxplayer seller fees remit` is the operator's
window onto the automatic path, and its recovery lever:

```
maxplayer seller fees remit [--home <dir>]              # dry run: recent attempts, resolve, quote, print the plan, move nothing
maxplayer seller fees remit --confirm [--home <dir>]    # pay the unremitted balance NOW (also with auto_remit = false)
```

The dry run prints whether the automatic remittance is on, the recent attempts with their outcomes
(paid / refused / failed and why), any attempt still in flight, the gross unremitted fee, the mint's
melt fee reserve, the invoice amount the platform receives, and the most that can leave your wallet —
and moves nothing. `--confirm` forces one attempt now, under exactly the same rules as the automatic
path. It refuses, moving nothing (exit 3), when nothing is unremitted; when the balance is below the
destination's minimum (the command prints how far short you are); when an earlier attempt is still
settling at the mint; or when an admitted attempt is held on its bound quote (the `HELD:` line above).
**Running it again after a payment pays nothing** — the receipts it discharged are recorded.

## 8. Lifecycle (seller side)

```
offer (3401)  →  claim (3402 status=processing)
              →  execute (ACP agent in seller-jobs/<job_id>)
              →  deliver (git push + 3403 with commit OID)
              →  collect (kind-1059 gift-wrap → fee-aware redeem of the cashu token)
```

1. **Offer** — buyer posts kind-3401. Offers may be targeted (`#p=<seller>`) or untargeted (open).
2. **Claim (nothing, until you say who may reach you)** — the daemon auto-claims an offer only if its author is a buyer you named, or the offer is `#p`-tagged to you and `accept_open_targeted = true`, or it is untargeted and `claim_open_pool = true`; then `amount ≥ rate_sats`. See §6. (Unattended claim-to-collect over a live offer used a harness in testing — see the autonomy caveat above.)
3. **Execute** — the ACP agent runs the task in the job workdir (real files / commit).
4. **Deliver** — push to the delivery remote (relay-git default or BYO); publish kind-3403 with the commit OID.
5. **Collect (working, fee-aware)** — when the buyer pays, a NIP-17 gift-wrapped cashu token (kind-1059) arrives for the seller pubkey. The daemon AUTH-then-reads `#p=seller` on the relay (p-gated), unwraps, predicts the mint fee, refuses dust up front, and redeems against your configured mint. Your wallet nets `face − fee`.

Watch the network: the observatory served from your relay's `/network`.

---

## 9. Minimal runbook

```bash
export MAXPLAYER_HOME="/tmp/maxplayer-seller-fresh-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$MAXPLAYER_HOME"

# first run — presets + relay-git default; only --agent and --rate-sats are required
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller \
  --home "$MAXPLAYER_HOME" \
  --agent claude \
  --rate-sats 100

# later: just relaunch (reads config.toml, zero prompts)
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller --home "$MAXPLAYER_HOME"
```

Startup status (stderr) looks like:

```text
maxplayer seller home=… key_present=true mint=https://mint.minibits.cash/Bitcoin relay=wss://relay.maxplayer.ai
git_remote defaulting to relay-git https://relay.maxplayer.ai/git/<pubkey>/m<pubkey-short>.git
wrote [seller] to …/config.toml
relay-git NIP-34 announce ok id=… remote=…

seller node starting pubkey=… agent=claude rate_sats=100 claim_open_pool=false accept_open_targeted=false accept_offers_only_from=0 git_remote=… (never-echo: key omitted)
```

It must **not** print the secret key. Leave it running: on a matching offer the daemon claims,
executes, delivers, then redeems on payment (fee-aware).

**Reading the log.** Every operator-facing line is prefixed with a `HH:MM:SSZ` UTC stamp, so you
can tell at a glance whether anything has happened since you last looked, and line the log up
against relay events. Every ~5 minutes the daemon states its own condition:

```text
14:32:07Z seller node status: ADVERTISING, ready for work · harness: claude · 0/1 job slot(s) busy
```

That line is the answer to "is it working": it arriving means the loop is turning, and it says
whether the seat is advertising and how much capacity is in use. `NOT serving — no live harness`
means the process is up but every harness has faulted out, so it will take no work.

Routine no-ops (a re-seen offer already claimed, a duplicate award) are hidden by default. Set
`MAXPLAYER_VERBOSE=1` in the daemon's environment to see them. Nothing that reports a state change
or a failure is behind that flag — you never have to enable it to see something go wrong.

Optional: BYO delivery + custom agent (power-user hatch):

```bash
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller --non-interactive \
  --home "$MAXPLAYER_HOME" \
  --agent-argv bun --agent-argv "$AGENT_WRAPPER" \
  --rate-sats 100 \
  --git-remote "https://github.com/<you>/<public-seller-repo>.git" \
  --job-timeout-secs 900
```

## 10. Day 2 — earnings, withdrawal, restart, reboot

The daemon is running and has taken work. These are the four things you do from here on.

### Check what you have earned

Collected jobs redeem into the seat's own wallet. Read it directly:

```bash
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" wallet balance
```

```text
mint=https://mint.minibits.cash/Bitcoin role=default balance_sats=1250
total_sats=1250
```

The command shows every configured mint (including zero balances) and every mint where the shared
wallet database holds spendable proofs. `total_sats` is the whole-wallet figure — with `--mint <url>`
both totals cover only the mint you asked about, never the mints the filter left out. If funds exist at
an unconfigured mint, its row has `role=unconfigured` and a separate `configured_total_sats` line
appears before the whole-wallet total — and that configured subset is what job payment can actually
draw on: accept-time source selection deliberately ignores unconfigured balances, so money at an
unconfigured mint is yours to `send`/`melt` manually but does not fund jobs until you
`wallet mints add` it. The daemon's own `seller node
status` line every ~5 minutes ([§9](#9-minimal-runbook)) tells you the loop is turning; `wallet
balance` tells you what it earned.

Remember the receipt records the **face** amount of the offer, while the wallet holds `face − mint fee`
([§7](#7-fees--rate--set---rate-sats-to-net-positive)). The balance is the number that is actually yours.

### Withdraw to Lightning

Your earnings are ecash at the mint. Withdrawing means melting it back to Lightning: create an
invoice in whatever Lightning wallet you want the sats in, then pay it from the seat:

```bash
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" wallet melt <bolt11>
```

The mint charges a fee on the melt as well as the redeem, so a withdrawal lands slightly under the
balance you started from. Check `wallet balance` afterwards to see where you ended up. If you hold
balances at several mints, `--mint <url>` selects which one the withdrawal comes from — otherwise it
uses the default (the first entry of `accepted_mints`).

### Stop and restart safely

Ctrl-C — or any ordinary stop — is safe, including mid-job. The seller journals every job's state
durably, and a restart reads that journal back and picks up where it left off:

- A job that was **awarded or executing** and has not delivered is re-driven: the agent runs again.
- A job whose commit was already **pushed** but not signed and announced is finalized from the stored
  commit — the agent does not re-run and nothing is re-pushed.
- A job already **delivered or paid** is left alone.

The one thing a stop can cost you is a deadline. Every offer carries an absolute deadline, and a job
whose deadline passes while the daemon is down is failed on restart rather than re-driven — a buyer
will not pay a delivery that arrives after settlement. Short restarts are free; a seat left down for
hours forfeits whatever was in flight.

An ordinary stop also takes your seat off the market. Ctrl-C and `systemctl stop` (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
let the daemon publish one last kind-30340 saying `accepting=n` before it exits, so the seat
announcement you leave behind says you are closed rather than open. You will see it in the log:

```
seller node: shutdown requested (SIGTERM); retracting the seat and ending the loop
seller node: publishing terminal kind-30340 (accepting=n) — retracting this seat
```

**This only works if the process gets to run.** `kill -9`, an OOM kill, a crash, or a power cut
publish nothing, and your last `accepting=y` then stays on the relay indefinitely — the seat
announcement is a replaceable event, so nothing supersedes it until you next start up. Prefer a plain
`systemctl stop` or Ctrl-C over `kill -9` when you have the choice. It is why readers are expected to
judge a seat announcement by its age rather than trust it outright, and why the retraction narrows
the window rather than closing it.

Restarting is the bare relaunch — config is already written:

```bash
"$MAXPLAYER_BIN" seller --home "$MAXPLAYER_HOME"
```

### Survive a reboot

A seat meant to earn overnight needs to come back by itself. Run it as a **systemd user service**:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/maxplayer-seller.service
[Unit]
Description=Maxplayer seller
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/maxplayer seller
Environment=MAXPLAYER_HOME=%h/.maxplayer
# The npm global bin dir must be here too if your adapter lives there (§3b).
Environment=PATH=%h/.local/bin:%h/.npm-global/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
# Anything the agent harness writes outside the seat home stays owner-only (§0b).
UMask=0077
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now maxplayer-seller
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"    # without this the service stops when you log out
```

`enable-linger` is the part that is easy to miss: a user service without it runs only while you have
a session open, so the seat dies at logout and never returns after a reboot.

Then check on it the same way you check anything else:

```bash
systemctl --user status maxplayer-seller
journalctl --user -u maxplayer-seller -f     # the status line every ~5 minutes
```

Credentials still have to be in **this** environment, not your login shell — an agent CLI that is
signed in for you is not signed in for the service unless its config lives under the same `%h`
([§3b](#3b-setup-gotchas--two-environment-prerequisites-that-silently-break-execute)).

## Acceptance checklist

```
→ first run needs ONLY --agent + --rate-sats; bare `maxplayer seller` relaunch is zero-prompt (reads config.toml)
→ fresh MAXPLAYER_HOME (key 0600, auto-generated, never echoed, never --key)
→ mint https://mint.minibits.cash/Bitcoin
→ --agent claude|cursor|codex resolves ACP internally; --agent-argv is the power-user hatch
→ gotcha 1: the adapter binary (claude-agent-acp / cursor-agent / codex-acp) is resolvable on the daemon's PATH (`command -v …`), else execute errors up front — no auto-npx fallback (§3b)
→ gotcha 2 (NixOS): CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE points at a NixOS-runnable claude; a PATH shim alone leaves the ACP/agent path dead (§3b)
→ delivery defaults to relay-git (NIP-34 announce → in-process NIP-98 push, no external git/helper); --git-remote for BYO https
→ discoverability: kind-0 profile on start; capability on the kind-30340 seat heartbeat, republished every ~5 min
→ both open surfaces off by default; --accept-open-targeted for targeted offers from unnamed buyers, --claim-open-pool for the open pool
→ --rate-sats defaults to 100, the rate buyers post at: wallet nets face − fee; receipt records FACE, not net; dust refused up front
```
