# allowlist: the mobee namespace IS the allowlist, so there is no write-policy plugin (the strfry
# plugin retires with the strfry relay it fronted). Born empty.
#
# TLS lives in the host (nix/relay-host.nix): nginx terminates and proxies wss -> 127.0.0.1:3000, so
# this module binds loopback only and never touches ACME. Postgres + Redis are provisioned here; the
# relay's stable identity key is supplied by the host as a file PATH (never in the repo).
#
# The package is wired from the flake as an option (`services.maxplayer.relay.package`): `.#relay`
# injects the in-tree vendored `buzz-relay` crate. Git-CAS + media objects live in S3 (the box's
# instance IAM role authorizes the bucket), so the box itself keeps only Postgres, Redis, the relay
# identity key, and a rehydratable local working cache.

        and carries a NIP-40 `expiration` tag. Wires BUZZ_SCOPED_TOKEN_MAX_LIFETIME_SECS.

        A seller mints one push token on the host BEFORE a sandboxed job starts and pushes with it at
        the end, minutes later, so the relay's ±60 s freshness window cannot serve that push. The ref
        scope is what makes the longer life safe: the token may write one branch of one repo, and the
        pre-receive hook enforces that exactly. UNSCOPED tokens keep the ±60 s window whatever this
        value says.

        Keep it at or above the longest job deadline the marketplace allows. A token that asks for
        more is REJECTED outright, not shortened, so raising the deadline without raising this value
        breaks delivery at push time. The effective value is advertised in the relay's NIP-11
        `limitation` object as `scoped_token_max_lifetime_secs`, which is how a client checks the cap
        before it mints. 0 switches the relaxation off and puts every token back on ±60 s — the
        exact rule from before this feature, so 0 is the rollback switch. The relay REFUSES to
        start on a value that is not a whole number of seconds; it never falls back to the
